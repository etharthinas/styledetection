0,asv,In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
1,asv,And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
2,asv,"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light."
3,asv,"And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness."
4,asv,"And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day."
5,asv,"And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."
6,asv,"And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so."
7,asv,"And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day."
8,asv,"And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so."
9,asv,And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
10,asv,"And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, `and' fruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth: and it was so."
11,asv,"And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after their kind: and God saw that it was good."
12,asv,"And there was evening and there was morning, a third day."
13,asv,"And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:"
14,asv,and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
15,asv,"And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: `he made' the stars also."
16,asv,"And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth,"
17,asv,"and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good."
18,asv,"And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day."
19,asv,"And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven."
20,asv,"And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moveth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind: and God saw that it was good."
21,asv,"And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."
22,asv,"And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day."
23,asv,"And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so."
24,asv,"And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the ground after its kind: and God saw that it was good."
25,asv,"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."
26,asv,"And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."
27,asv,"And God blessed them: and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."
28,asv,"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food:"
29,asv,"and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, `I have given' every green herb for food: and it was so."
30,asv,"And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day."
31,asv,"And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them."
32,asv,And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
33,asv,"And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made."
34,asv,"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven."
35,asv,"And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth: and there was not a man to till the ground;"
36,asv,"but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground."
37,asv,"And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."
38,asv,"And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed."
39,asv,"And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil."
40,asv,"And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads."
41,asv,"The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;"
42,asv,and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
43,asv,And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush.
44,asv,And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
45,asv,"And Jehovah God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it."
46,asv,"And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:"
47,asv,"but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."
48,asv,"And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him."
49,asv,"And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them: and whatsoever the man called every living creature, that was the name thereof."
50,asv,"And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not found a help meet for him."
51,asv,"And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof:"
52,asv,"and the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man."
53,asv,"And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."
54,asv,"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."
55,asv,"And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed."
56,asv,"Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?"
57,asv,"And the woman said unto the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat:"
58,asv,"but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die."
59,asv,"And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:"
60,asv,"for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil."
61,asv,"And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat."
62,asv,"And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons."
63,asv,And they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God amongst the trees of the garden.
64,asv,"And Jehovah God called unto the man, and said unto him, Where art thou?"
65,asv,"And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."
66,asv,"And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?"
67,asv,"And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat."
68,asv,"And Jehovah God said unto the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat."
69,asv,"And Jehovah God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:"
70,asv,"and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."
71,asv,"Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy conception; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee."
72,asv,"And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;"
73,asv,thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
74,asv,"in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return."
75,asv,And the man called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
76,asv,"And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them."
77,asv,"And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever-"
78,asv,"therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken."
79,asv,"So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life."
80,asv,"And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man with `the help of' Jehovah."
81,asv,"And again she bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground."
82,asv,"And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Jehovah."
83,asv,"And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Jehovah had respect unto Abel and to his offering:"
84,asv,"but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell."
85,asv,"And Jehovah said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?"
86,asv,"If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door: and unto thee shall be its desire, but do thou rule over it."
87,asv,"And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him."
88,asv,"And Jehovah said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother's keeper?"
89,asv,"And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground."
90,asv,"And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;"
91,asv,"when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth."
92,asv,"And Cain said unto Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear."
93,asv,"Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me."
94,asv,"And Jehovah said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him."
95,asv,"And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden."
96,asv,"And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch."
97,asv,And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methushael; and Methushael begat Lamech.
98,asv,"And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah."
99,asv,And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and `have' cattle.
100,asv,And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.
101,asv,"And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah."
102,asv,"And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me:"
103,asv,"If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold."
104,asv,"And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth. For, `said she', God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him."
105,asv,"And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then began men to call upon the name of Jehovah."
106,asv,"This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;"
107,asv,"male and female created he them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created."
108,asv,"And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat `a son' in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:"
109,asv,and the days of Adam after he begat Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters.
110,asv,And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.
111,asv,"And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begat Enosh:"
112,asv,"and Seth lived after he begat Enosh eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:"
113,asv,and all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.
114,asv,"And Enosh lived ninety years, and begat Kenan."
115,asv,"and Enosh lived after he begat Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:"
116,asv,and all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years: and he died.
117,asv,"And Kenan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalalel:"
118,asv,"and Kenan lived after he begat Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:"
119,asv,and all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.
120,asv,"And Mahalalel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:"
121,asv,"And Mahalalel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:"
122,asv,and all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.
123,asv,"And Jared lived a hundred sixty and two years, and begat Enoch:"
124,asv,"and Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:"
125,asv,And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.
126,asv,"And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:"
127,asv,"and Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:"
128,asv,and all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:
129,asv,and Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.
130,asv,"And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech:"
131,asv,"and Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters."
132,asv,And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.
133,asv,"And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:"
134,asv,"and he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, `which cometh' because of the ground which Jehovah hath cursed."
135,asv,"And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:"
136,asv,And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.
137,asv,"And Noah was five hundred years old: And Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
138,asv,"And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born unto them,"
139,asv,that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all that they chose.
140,asv,"And Jehovah said, My spirit shall not strive with man for ever, for that he also is flesh: yet shall his days be a hundred and twenty years."
141,asv,"The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them: the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown."
142,asv,"And Jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."
143,asv,"And it repented Jehovah that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart."
144,asv,"And Jehovah said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the ground; both man, and beast, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; for it repenteth me that I have made them."
145,asv,But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.
146,asv,"These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, `and' perfect in his generations: Noah walked with God."
147,asv,"And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
148,asv,"And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence."
149,asv,"And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth."
150,asv,"And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth."
151,asv,"Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch."
152,asv,"And this is how thou shalt make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits."
153,asv,"A light shalt thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it upward; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it."
154,asv,"And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon this earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; everything that is in the earth shall die."
155,asv,"But I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee."
156,asv,"And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female."
157,asv,"Of the birds after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive."
158,asv,"And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them."
159,asv,"Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he."
160,asv,"And Jehovah said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation."
161,asv,"Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven, the male and his female; and of the beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female:"
162,asv,"of the birds also of the heavens, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth."
163,asv,"For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the ground."
164,asv,And Noah did according unto all that Jehovah commanded him.
165,asv,And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
166,asv,"And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood."
167,asv,"Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creepeth upon the ground,"
168,asv,"there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as God commanded Noah."
169,asv,"And it came to pass after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth."
170,asv,"In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened."
171,asv,And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
172,asv,"In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;"
173,asv,"they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort."
174,asv,"And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life."
175,asv,"And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him: and Jehovah shut him in."
176,asv,"And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth."
177,asv,"And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters."
178,asv,And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered.
179,asv,Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
180,asv,"And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both birds, and cattle, and beasts, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:"
181,asv,"all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died."
182,asv,"And every living thing was destroyed that was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only was left, and they that were with him in the ark."
183,asv,And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.
184,asv,"And God remembered Noah, and all the beasts, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged;"
185,asv,"the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;"
186,asv,and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased.
187,asv,"And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat."
188,asv,"And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen."
189,asv,"And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:"
190,asv,"and he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth."
191,asv,"And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;"
192,asv,"but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him to the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark."
193,asv,And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
194,asv,"and the dove came in to him at eventide; and, lo, in her mouth an olive-leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth."
195,asv,"And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she returned not again unto him any more."
196,asv,"And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dried."
197,asv,"And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dry."
198,asv,"And God spake unto Noah, saying,"
199,asv,"Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee."
200,asv,"Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both birds, and cattle, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth."
201,asv,"And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:"
202,asv,"every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatsoever moveth upon the earth, after their families, went forth out of the ark."
203,asv,"And Noah builded an altar unto Jehovah, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar."
204,asv,"And Jehovah smelled the sweet savor; and Jehovah said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake, for that the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more everything living, as I have done."
205,asv,"While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."
206,asv,"And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth."
207,asv,"And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the heavens; With all wherewith the ground teemeth, and all the fishes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered."
208,asv,Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; As the green herb have I given you all.
209,asv,"But flesh with the life thereof, `which is' the blood thereof, shall ye not eat."
210,asv,"And surely your blood, `the blood' of your lives, will I require; At the hand of every beast will I require it. And at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother, will I require the life of man."
211,asv,"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: For in the image of God made he man."
212,asv,"And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; Bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein."
213,asv,"And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,"
214,asv,"And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;"
215,asv,"and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you. Of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth."
216,asv,And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
217,asv,"And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:"
218,asv,"I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth."
219,asv,"And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud,"
220,asv,"and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh."
221,asv,"And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth."
222,asv,"And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth."
223,asv,"And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan."
224,asv,These three were the sons of Noah: and of these was the whole earth overspread.
225,asv,"And Noah began to be a husbandman, and planted a vineyard:"
226,asv,"and he drank of the wine, and was drunken. And he was uncovered within his tent."
227,asv,"And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without."
228,asv,"And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father. And their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness."
229,asv,"And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done unto him."
230,asv,"And he said, Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren."
231,asv,"And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant."
232,asv,"God enlarge Japheth, And let him dwell in the tents of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant."
233,asv,And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
234,asv,And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: And he died.
235,asv,"Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, `namely', of Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood."
236,asv,"The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras."
237,asv,"And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah."
238,asv,"And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim."
239,asv,"Of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations."
240,asv,"And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan."
241,asv,"And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan."
242,asv,And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
243,asv,"He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah: wherefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before Jehovah."
244,asv,"And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar."
245,asv,"Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-ir, and Calah,"
246,asv,and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).
247,asv,"And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,"
248,asv,"and Pathrusim, and Casluhim (whence went forth the Philistines), and Caphtorim."
249,asv,"And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth,"
250,asv,"and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,"
251,asv,"and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,"
252,asv,"and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad."
253,asv,"And the border of the Canaanite was from Sidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha."
254,asv,"These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations."
255,asv,"And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born."
256,asv,"The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram."
257,asv,"And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash."
258,asv,And Arpachshad begat Shelah; and Shelah begat Eber.
259,asv,And unto Eber were born two sons: The name of the one was Peleg. For in his days was the earth divided. And his brother's name was Joktan.
260,asv,"And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,"
261,asv,"and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,"
262,asv,"and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,"
263,asv,"and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan."
264,asv,"And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, the mountain of the east."
265,asv,"These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations."
266,asv,"These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood."
267,asv,And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
268,asv,"And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there."
269,asv,"And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar."
270,asv,"And they said, Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top `may reach' unto heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth."
271,asv,"And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded."
272,asv,"And Jehovah said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do."
273,asv,"Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech."
274,asv,So Jehovah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off building the city.
275,asv,Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because Jehovah did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did Jehovah scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
276,asv,"These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begat Arpachshad two years after the flood."
277,asv,"and Shem lived after he begat Arpachshad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
278,asv,"And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shelah."
279,asv,"and Arpachshad lived after he begat Shelah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters."
280,asv,"And Shelah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:"
281,asv,"and Shelah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters."
282,asv,"And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:"
283,asv,"and Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters."
284,asv,"And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:"
285,asv,"and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters."
286,asv,"And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:"
287,asv,"and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters."
288,asv,"And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:"
289,asv,"and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
290,asv,"And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:"
291,asv,"and Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters."
292,asv,"And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran."
293,asv,"Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran begat Lot."
294,asv,"And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees."
295,asv,"And Abram and Nahor took them wives: The name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah."
296,asv,And Sarai was barren; She had no child.
297,asv,"And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there."
298,asv,And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
299,asv,"Now Jehovah said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto the land that I will show thee:"
300,asv,"and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make they name great; and be thou a blessing;"
301,asv,"and I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse: and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
302,asv,"So Abram went, as Jehovah had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran."
303,asv,"And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came."
304,asv,"And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land."
305,asv,"And Jehovah appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto Jehovah, who appeared unto him."
306,asv,"And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto Jehovah, and called upon the name of Jehovah."
307,asv,"And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South."
308,asv,And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was sore in the land.
309,asv,"And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:"
310,asv,"and it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive."
311,asv,"Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister; that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee."
312,asv,"And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair."
313,asv,"And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house."
314,asv,"And he dealt well with Abram for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels."
315,asv,"And Jehovah plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife."
316,asv,"And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?"
317,asv,"why saidst thou, She is my sister, so that I took her to be my wife? now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way."
318,asv,"And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him: and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had."
319,asv,"And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South."
320,asv,"And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold."
321,asv,"And he went on his journeys from the South even to Beth-el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Ai,"
322,asv,"unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of Jehovah."
323,asv,"And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents."
324,asv,"And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together."
325,asv,And there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land.
326,asv,"And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen; for we are brethren."
327,asv,"Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me. If `thou wilt take' the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if `thou take' the right hand, then I will go to the left."
328,asv,"And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the Plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, as thou goest unto Zoar."
329,asv,So Lot chose him all the Plain of the Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
330,asv,"Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the Plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom."
331,asv,Now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against Jehovah exceedingly.
332,asv,"And Jehovah said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward and southward and eastward and westward:"
333,asv,"for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever."
334,asv,"And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: So that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then may thy seed also be numbered."
335,asv,"Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for unto thee will I give it."
336,asv,"And Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built there an altar unto Jehovah."
337,asv,"And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,"
338,asv,"that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar)."
339,asv,All these joined together in the vale of Siddim (the same is the Salt Sea).
340,asv,"Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled."
341,asv,"And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,"
342,asv,"and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness."
343,asv,"And they returned, and came to En-mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon-tamar."
344,asv,"And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar); and they set the battle in array against them in the vale of Siddim;"
345,asv,"against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five."
346,asv,"Now the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and they that remained fled to the mountain."
347,asv,"And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way."
348,asv,"And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed."
349,asv,"And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew: now he dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were confederate with Abram."
350,asv,"And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan."
351,asv,"And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus."
352,asv,"And he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people."
353,asv,"And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, at the vale of Shaveh (the same is the King's Vale)."
354,asv,And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was priest of God Most High.
355,asv,"And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth:"
356,asv,"and blessed be God Most High, who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him a tenth of all."
357,asv,"And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself."
358,asv,"And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand unto Jehovah, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,"
359,asv,"that I will not take a thread nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:"
360,asv,"save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men that went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their portion."
361,asv,"After these things the word of Jehovah came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, `and' thy exceeding great reward."
362,asv,"And Abram said, O Lord Jehovah, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and he that shall be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?"
363,asv,"And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir."
364,asv,"And, behold, the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying, This man shall not be thine heir; But he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir."
365,asv,"And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and number the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be."
366,asv,And he believed in Jehovah; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.
367,asv,"And he said unto him, I am Jehovah that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it."
368,asv,"And he said, O Lord Jehovah, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?"
369,asv,"And he said unto him, Take me a heifer three years old, and a she-goat three years old, and a ram three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon."
370,asv,"And he took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half over against the other: but the birds divided he not."
371,asv,"And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away."
372,asv,"And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him."
373,asv,"And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;"
374,asv,"and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance."
375,asv,But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
376,asv,And in the fourth generation they shall come hither again; for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.
377,asv,"And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces."
378,asv,"In that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:"
379,asv,"the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,"
380,asv,"and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,"
381,asv,"and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite."
382,asv,"Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bare him no children: and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar."
383,asv,"And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, Jehovah hath restrained me from bearing; go in, I pray thee, unto my handmaid; it may be that I shall obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai."
384,asv,"And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife."
385,asv,"And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes."
386,asv,"And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I gave my handmaid into they bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: Jehovah judge between me and thee."
387,asv,"But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her that which is good in thine eyes. And Sarai dealt hardly with her, and she fled from her face."
388,asv,"And the angel of Jehovah found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur."
389,asv,"And he said, Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, whence camest thou? and whither goest thou? And she said, I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai."
390,asv,"And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands."
391,asv,"And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, I will greatly multiply thy seed, that it shall not be numbered for multitude."
392,asv,"And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son; and thou shalt call his name Ishmael, because Jehovah hath heard thy affliction."
393,asv,"And he shall be `as' a wild ass among men; his hand `shall be' against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell over against all his brethren."
394,asv,"And she called the name of Jehovah that spake unto her, Thou art a God that seeth: for she said, Have I even here looked after him that seeth me?"
395,asv,"Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered."
396,asv,"And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bare, Ishmael."
397,asv,"And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram."
398,asv,"And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, Jehovah appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be thou perfect."
399,asv,"And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly."
400,asv,"And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,"
401,asv,"As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be the father of a multitude of nations."
402,asv,"Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for the father of a multitude of nations have I made thee."
403,asv,"And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee."
404,asv,"And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee."
405,asv,"And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God."
406,asv,"And God said unto Abraham, And as for thee, thou shalt keep my covenant, thou, and thy seed after thee throughout their generations."
407,asv,"This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee: every male among you shall be circumcised."
408,asv,And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt me and you.
409,asv,"And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any foreigner that is not of thy seed."
410,asv,"He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant."
411,asv,"And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant."
412,asv,"And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be."
413,asv,"And I will bless her, and moreover I will give thee a son of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be `a mother of' nations; kings of peoples shall be of her."
414,asv,"Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?"
415,asv,"And Abraham said unto God, Oh that Ishmael might live before thee!"
416,asv,"And God said, Nay, but Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him."
417,asv,"And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation."
418,asv,"But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year."
419,asv,"And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham."
420,asv,"And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him."
421,asv,"And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin."
422,asv,"And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin."
423,asv,"In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son."
424,asv,"And all the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money of a foreigner, were circumcised with him."
425,asv,"And Jehovah appeared unto him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;"
426,asv,"and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood over against him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,"
427,asv,"and said, My lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:"
428,asv,"let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:"
429,asv,"and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart; after that ye shall pass on: forasmuch as ye are come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said."
430,asv,"And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes."
431,asv,"And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto the servant; and he hasted to dress it."
432,asv,"And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat."
433,asv,"And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent."
434,asv,"And he said, I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him."
435,asv,"Now Abraham and Sarah were old, `and' well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women."
436,asv,"And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?"
437,asv,"And Jehovah said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, who am old?"
438,asv,"Is anything too hard for Jehovah? At the set time I will return unto thee, when the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son."
439,asv,"Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh."
440,asv,"And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way."
441,asv,"And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do;"
442,asv,"seeing that Abraham had surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?"
443,asv,"For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him."
444,asv,"And Jehovah said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;"
445,asv,"I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know."
446,asv,"And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before Jehovah."
447,asv,"And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked?"
448,asv,Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
449,asv,"That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"
450,asv,"And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake."
451,asv,"And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes:"
452,asv,"peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five."
453,asv,"And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty's sake."
454,asv,"And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there."
455,asv,"And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twenty's sake."
456,asv,"And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten's sake."
457,asv,"And Jehovah went his way, as soon as he had left off communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place."
458,asv,"And the two angels came to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth;"
459,asv,"and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn aside, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your way. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night."
460,asv,"And he urged them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat."
461,asv,"But before they lay down, the men of the city, `even' the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both young and old, all the people from every quarter;"
462,asv,"and they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men that came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them."
463,asv,"And Lot went out unto them to the door, and shut the door after him."
464,asv,"And he said, I pray you, my brethren, do not so wickedly."
465,asv,"Behold now, I have two daughters that have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing, forasmuch as they are come under the shadow of my roof."
466,asv,"And they said, Stand back. And they said, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and drew near to break the door."
467,asv,"But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door."
468,asv,"And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door."
469,asv,"And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whomsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of the place:"
470,asv,"for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxed great before Jehovah: and Jehovah hath sent us to destroy it."
471,asv,"And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for Jehovah will destroy the city. But he seemed unto his sons-in-law as one that mocked."
472,asv,"And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters that are here, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city."
473,asv,"But he lingered; and the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters, Jehovah being merciful unto him; and they brought him forth, and set him without the city."
474,asv,"And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the Plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed."
475,asv,"And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my lord:"
476,asv,"behold now, thy servant hath found favor in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy lovingkindness, which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die:"
477,asv,"behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape thither (is it not a little one?), and my soul shall live."
478,asv,"And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken."
479,asv,"Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar."
480,asv,The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came unto Zoar.
481,asv,Then Jehovah rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven;
482,asv,"and he overthrew those cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground."
483,asv,"But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt."
484,asv,And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Jehovah:
485,asv,"and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the Plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace."
486,asv,"And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt."
487,asv,"And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters."
488,asv,"And the first-born said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:"
489,asv,"come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father."
490,asv,"And they made their father drink wine that night: and the first-born went in, and lay with her father; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
491,asv,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the first-born said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father."
492,asv,"And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
493,asv,Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
494,asv,"And the first-born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day."
495,asv,"And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day."
496,asv,"And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur. And he sojourned in Gerar."
497,asv,"And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister. And Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah."
498,asv,"But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, because of the woman whom thou hast taken. For she is a man's wife."
499,asv,"Now Abimelech had not come near her. And he said, Lord, wilt thou slay even a righteous nation?"
500,asv,"Said he not himself unto me, She is my sister? And she, even she herself said, He is my brother. In the integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have I done this."
501,asv,"And God said unto him in the dream, Yea, I know that in the integrity of thy heart thou has done this, and I also withheld thee from sinning against me. Therefore suffered I thee not to touch her."
502,asv,"Now therefore restore the man's wife. For he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live. And if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine."
503,asv,"And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. And the men were sore afraid."
504,asv,"Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? And wherein have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? Thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done."
505,asv,"And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?"
506,asv,"And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place. And they will slay me for my wife's sake."
507,asv,"And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife:"
508,asv,"and it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me. At every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother."
509,asv,"And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and men-servants and women-servants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife."
510,asv,"And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee. Dwell where it pleaseth thee."
511,asv,"And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee. And in respect of all thou art righted."
512,asv,"And Abraham prayed unto God. And God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants. And they bare children."
513,asv,"For Jehovah had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife."
514,asv,"And Jehovah visited Sarah as he had said, and Jehovah did unto Sarah as he had spoken."
515,asv,"And Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him."
516,asv,"And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac."
517,asv,"And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him."
518,asv,"And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him."
519,asv,"And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh. Every one that heareth will laugh with me."
520,asv,"And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should give children suck? For I have borne him a son in his old age."
521,asv,"And the child grew, and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned."
522,asv,"And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne unto Abraham, mocking."
523,asv,"Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her son. For the son of this handmaid shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac."
524,asv,And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son.
525,asv,"And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy handmaid. In all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice. For in Isaac shall thy seed be called."
526,asv,"And also of the son of the handmaid will I make a nation, because he is thy seed."
527,asv,"And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and `gave her' the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba."
528,asv,"And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs."
529,asv,"And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot. For she said, Let me not look upon the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept."
530,asv,"And God heard the voice of the lad. And the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? Fear not. For God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is."
531,asv,"Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand. For I will make him a great nation."
532,asv,"And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink."
533,asv,"And God was with the lad, and he grew. And he dwelt in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer."
534,asv,And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
535,asv,"And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest."
536,asv,"Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son. But according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned."
537,asv,"And Abraham said, I will swear."
538,asv,"And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away."
539,asv,"And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing. Neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to-day."
540,asv,"And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech. And they two made a covenant."
541,asv,And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
542,asv,"And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?"
543,asv,"And he said, These seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well."
544,asv,Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba. Because there they sware both of them.
545,asv,"So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. And Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines."
546,asv,"And `Abraham' planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of Jehovah, the Everlasting God."
547,asv,And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.
548,asv,"And it came to pass after these things, that God did prove Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham. And he said, Here am I."
549,asv,"And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah. And offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of."
550,asv,"And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. And he clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him."
551,asv,"On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off."
552,asv,"And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come again to you."
553,asv,"And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. And they went both of them together."
554,asv,"And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood. But where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?"
555,asv,"And Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son. So they went both of them together."
556,asv,"And they came to the place which God had told him of. And Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood."
557,asv,"And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son."
558,asv,"And the angel of Jehovah called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here I am."
559,asv,"And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him. For now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me."
560,asv,"And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind `him' a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son."
561,asv,"And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh. As it is said to this day, In the mount of Jehovah it shall be provided."
562,asv,"And the angel of Jehovah called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven,"
563,asv,"and said, By myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son,"
564,asv,"that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is upon the seashore. And thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies."
565,asv,And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. Because thou hast obeyed my voice.
566,asv,"So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba. And Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba."
567,asv,"And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also hath borne children unto they brother Nahor."
568,asv,"Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram."
569,asv,"And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
570,asv,"And Bethuel begat Rebekah. These eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother."
571,asv,"And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bare Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah."
572,asv,And the life of Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years. These were the years of the life of Sarah.
573,asv,"And Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan. And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her."
574,asv,"And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spake unto the children of Heth, saying,"
575,asv,"I am a stranger and a sojourner with you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
576,asv,"And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,"
577,asv,"Hear us, my lord. Thou art a prince of God among us. In the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead. None of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead."
578,asv,"And Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth."
579,asv,"And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,"
580,asv,"that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in the midst of you for a possession of a burying-place."
581,asv,"Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,"
582,asv,"Nay, my lord, hear me. The field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee. In the presence of the children of my people give I it thee. Bury thy dead."
583,asv,And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.
584,asv,"And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt, I pray thee, hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it of me, and I will bury my dead there."
585,asv,"And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,"
586,asv,"My lord, hearken unto me. A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that betwixt me and thee? Bury therefore thy dead."
587,asv,"And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron. And Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current `money' with the merchant."
588,asv,"So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the border thereof round about, were made sure"
589,asv,"unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city."
590,asv,"And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan."
591,asv,"And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a burying-place by the children of Heth."
592,asv,"And Abraham was old, `and' well stricken in age. And Jehovah had blessed Abraham in all things."
593,asv,"And Abraham said unto his servant, the elder of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh."
594,asv,"And I will make thee swear by Jehovah, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that thou wilt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell."
595,asv,"But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac."
596,asv,"And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land. Must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?"
597,asv,"And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again."
598,asv,"Jehovah, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my nativity, and who spake unto me, and who sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land. He will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence."
599,asv,"And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath. Only thou shalt not bring my son thither again."
600,asv,"And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning this matter."
601,asv,"And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed, having all goodly things of his master's in his hand. And he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor."
602,asv,"And he made the camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water."
603,asv,"And he said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, send me, I pray thee, good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master Abraham."
604,asv,"Behold, I am standing by the fountain of water. And the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water."
605,asv,"And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink. And she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. Let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac. And thereby shall I know that thou hast showed kindness unto my master."
606,asv,"And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder."
607,asv,"And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her. And she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher, and came up."
608,asv,"And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher."
609,asv,"And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink."
610,asv,"And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw for thy camels also, until they have done drinking."
611,asv,"And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw, and drew for all his camels."
612,asv,"And the man looked stedfastly on her, holding his peace, to know whether Jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not."
613,asv,"And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,"
614,asv,"and said, Whose daughter art thou? Tell me, I pray thee. Is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?"
615,asv,"And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bare unto Nahor."
616,asv,"She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in."
617,asv,"And the man bowed his head, and worshipped Jehovah."
618,asv,"And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who hath not forsaken his lovingkindness and his truth toward my master. As for me, Jehovah hath led me in the way to the house of my master's brethren."
619,asv,"And the damsel ran, and told her mother's house according to these words."
620,asv,"And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the fountain."
621,asv,"And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me. That he came unto the man. And, behold, he was standing by the camels at the fountain."
622,asv,"And he said, Come in, thou blessed of Jehovah. Wherefore standest thou without? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels."
623,asv,"And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels. And he gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men that were with him."
624,asv,"And there was set food before him to eat. But he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on."
625,asv,"And he said, I am Abraham's servant."
626,asv,"And Jehovah hath blessed my master greatly. And he is become great. And he hath given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and men-servants and maid-servants, and camels and asses."
627,asv,And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old. And unto him hath he given all that he hath.
628,asv,"And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell."
629,asv,"But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son."
630,asv,"And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me."
631,asv,"And he said unto me, Jehovah, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way. And thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house."
632,asv,"Then shalt thou be clear from my oath, when thou comest to my kindred. And if they give her not to thee, thou shalt be clear from my oath."
633,asv,"And I came this day unto the fountain, and said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go."
634,asv,"Behold, I am standing by the fountain of water. And let it come to pass, that the maiden that cometh forth to draw, to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher to drink."
635,asv,"And she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels. Let the same be the woman whom Jehovah hath appointed for my master's son."
636,asv,"And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder. And she went down unto the fountain, and drew. And I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee."
637,asv,"And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. So I drank, and she made the camels drink also."
638,asv,"And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him. And I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands."
639,asv,"And I bowed my head, and worshipped Jehovah, and blessed Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son."
640,asv,"And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. And if not, tell me. That I may turn to the right hand, or to the left."
641,asv,"Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from Jehovah. We cannot speak unto thee bad or good."
642,asv,"Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as Jehovah hath spoken."
643,asv,"And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth unto Jehovah."
644,asv,"And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah. He gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things."
645,asv,"And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night. And they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master."
646,asv,"And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us `a few' days, at the least ten. After that she shall go."
647,asv,"And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing Jehovah hath prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master."
648,asv,"And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth."
649,asv,"And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go."
650,asv,"And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men."
651,asv,"And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Our sister, be thou `the mother' of thousands of ten thousands, and let thy seed possess the gate of those that hate them."
652,asv,"And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebekah, and went his way."
653,asv,And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi. For he dwelt in the land of the South.
654,asv,"And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming."
655,asv,"And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel."
656,asv,"And she said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master. And she took her veil, and covered herself."
657,asv,And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
658,asv,"And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife. And he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after his mother's death."
659,asv,"And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah."
660,asv,"And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah."
661,asv,"And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim."
662,asv,"And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah."
663,asv,And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
664,asv,"But unto the sons of the concubines, that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts. And he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country."
665,asv,"And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred threescore and fifteen years."
666,asv,"And Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full `of years', and was gathered to his people."
667,asv,"And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre."
668,asv,"The field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth. There was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife."
669,asv,"And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son. And Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi."
670,asv,"Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham."
671,asv,"And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth, and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,"
672,asv,"and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,"
673,asv,"Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah."
674,asv,"These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments. Twelve princes according to their nations."
675,asv,"And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and seven years. And he gave up the ghost and died, and was gathered unto his people."
676,asv,"And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria. He abode over against all his brethren."
677,asv,"And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham begat Isaac."
678,asv,"And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife."
679,asv,"And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren. And Jehovah was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived."
680,asv,"And the children struggled together within her. And she said, If it be so, wherefore do I live? And she went to inquire of Jehovah."
681,asv,"And Jehovah said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels. And the one people shall be stronger than the other people. And the elder shall serve the younger."
682,asv,"And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb."
683,asv,"And the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment. And they called his name Esau."
684,asv,"And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau's heel. And his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them."
685,asv,"And the boys grew. And Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field. And Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents."
686,asv,"Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison. And Rebekah loved Jacob."
687,asv,"And Jacob boiled pottage. And Esau came in from the field, and he was faint."
688,asv,"And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red `pottage'. For I am faint. Therefore was his name called Edom."
689,asv,"And Jacob said, Sell me first thy birthright."
690,asv,"And Esau said, Behold, I am about to die. And what profit shall the birthright do to me?"
691,asv,"And Jacob said, Swear to me first. And he sware unto him. And he sold his birthright unto Jacob."
692,asv,"And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils. And he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright."
693,asv,"And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines, unto Gerar."
694,asv,"And Jehovah appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt. Dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of."
695,asv,"Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee. For unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father."
696,asv,"And I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these lands. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed."
697,asv,"Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
698,asv,And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.
699,asv,"And the men of the place asked him of his wife. And he said, She is my sister. For he feared to say, My wife. Lest, `said he', the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah. Because she was fair to look upon."
700,asv,"And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife."
701,asv,"And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife. And how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die because of her."
702,asv,"And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? One of the people might easily have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldest have brought guiltiness upon us."
703,asv,"And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death."
704,asv,"And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year a hundredfold. And Jehovah blessed him."
705,asv,"And the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great."
706,asv,"And he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household. And the Philistines envied him."
707,asv,"Now all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth."
708,asv,"And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us. For thou art much mightier than we."
709,asv,"And Isaac departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there."
710,asv,"And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. And he called their names after the names by which his father had called them."
711,asv,"And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water."
712,asv,"And the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The water is ours. And he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him."
713,asv,"And they digged another well, and they strove for that also. And he called the name of it Sitnah."
714,asv,"And he removed from thence, and digged another well. And for that they strove not. And he called the name of it Rehoboth. And he said, For now Jehovah hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land."
715,asv,And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.
716,asv,"And Jehovah appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father. Fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake."
717,asv,"And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of Jehovah, and pitched his tent there. And there Isaac's servants digged a well."
718,asv,"Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his host."
719,asv,"And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore are ye come unto me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?"
720,asv,"And they said, We saw plainly that Jehovah was with thee. And we said, Let there now be an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee,"
721,asv,"that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace. Thou art now the blessed of Jehovah."
722,asv,"And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink."
723,asv,"And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another. And Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace."
724,asv,"And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water."
725,asv,And he called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day.
726,asv,"And when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite."
727,asv,And they were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
728,asv,"And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said unto him, My son. And he said unto him, Here am I."
729,asv,"And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death."
730,asv,"Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison."
731,asv,"And make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat. That my soul may bless thee before I die."
732,asv,"And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it."
733,asv,"And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,"
734,asv,"Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless thee before Jehovah before my death."
735,asv,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee."
736,asv,"Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats. And I will make them savory food for thy father, such as he loveth."
737,asv,"And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, so that he may bless thee before his death."
738,asv,"And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man."
739,asv,"My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver. And I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing."
740,asv,"And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son. Only obey my voice, and go fetch me them."
741,asv,"And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother. And his mother made savory food, such as his father loved."
742,asv,"And Rebekah took the goodly garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son."
743,asv,"And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck."
744,asv,"And she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob."
745,asv,"And he came unto his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here am I. Who art thou, my son?"
746,asv,"And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first-born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me."
747,asv,"And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah thy God sent me good speed."
748,asv,"And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not."
749,asv,"And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father. And he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
750,asv,"And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands. So he blessed him."
751,asv,"And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am."
752,asv,"And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat. And he brought him wine, and he drank."
753,asv,"And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son."
754,asv,"And he came near, and kissed him. And he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son Is as the smell of a field which Jehovah hath blessed."
755,asv,"And God give thee of the dew of heaven, And of the fatness of the earth, And plenty of grain and new wine."
756,asv,"Let peoples serve thee, And nations bow down to thee. Be lord over thy brethren, And let thy mother's sons bow down to thee. Cursed be every one that curseth thee, And blessed be every one that blesseth thee."
757,asv,"And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting."
758,asv,"And he also made savory food, and brought it unto his father. And he said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me."
759,asv,"And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy first-born, Esau."
760,asv,"And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who then is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? Yea, `and' he shall be blessed."
761,asv,"When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father."
762,asv,"And he said, Thy brother came with guile, and hath taken away thy blessing."
763,asv,"And he said, Is not he rightly name Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two time. He took away my birthright. And, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?"
764,asv,"And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants. And with grain and new wine have I sustained him. And what then shall I do for thee, my son?"
765,asv,"And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept."
766,asv,"And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, of the fatness of the earth shall be thy dwelling, And of the dew of heaven from above."
767,asv,"And by thy sword shalt thou live, and thou shalt serve thy brother. And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt break loose, That thou shalt shake his yoke from off thy neck."
768,asv,"And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him. And Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then will I slay my brother Jacob."
769,asv,"And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah. And she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, `purposing' to kill thee."
770,asv,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. And arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran."
771,asv,"And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away."
772,asv,"Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him. Then I will send, and fetch thee from thence. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?"
773,asv,"And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?"
774,asv,"And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan."
775,asv,"Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father. And take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother."
776,asv,"And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a company of peoples."
777,asv,"And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee. That thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojournings, which God gave unto Abraham."
778,asv,"And Isaac sent away Jacob. And he went to Paddan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother."
779,asv,"Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram, to take him a wife from thence. And that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan."
780,asv,"And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan-aram."
781,asv,And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father.
782,asv,"And Esau went unto Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife."
783,asv,"And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran."
784,asv,"And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set. And he took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep."
785,asv,"And he dreamed. And behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it."
786,asv,"And, behold, Jehovah stood above it, and said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac. The land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed."
787,asv,"And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. And in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
788,asv,"And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee, whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land. For I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of."
789,asv,"And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely Jehovah is in this place. And I knew it not."
790,asv,"And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."
791,asv,"And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it."
792,asv,And he called the name of that place Beth-el. But the name of the city was Luz at the first.
793,asv,"And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,"
794,asv,"so that I come again to my father's house in peace, and Jehovah will be my God,"
795,asv,"then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house. And of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee."
796,asv,"Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east."
797,asv,"And he looked, and behold, a well in the field, and, lo, three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out of that well they watered the flocks. And the stone upon the well's mouth was great."
798,asv,"And thither were all the flocks gathered. And they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in its place."
799,asv,"And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence are ye? And they said, Of Haran are we."
800,asv,"And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him."
801,asv,"And he said unto them, Is it well with him? And they said, It is well. And, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep."
802,asv,"And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together. Water ye the sheep, and go and feed them."
803,asv,"And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth. Then we water the sheep."
804,asv,"While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep. For she kept them."
805,asv,"And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother."
806,asv,"And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept."
807,asv,"And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son. And she ran and told her father."
808,asv,"And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things."
809,asv,"And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month."
810,asv,"And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? Tell me, what shall thy wages be?"
811,asv,"And Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel."
812,asv,And Leah's eyes were tender. But Rachel was beautiful and well favored.
813,asv,"And Jacob loved Rachel. And he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter."
814,asv,"And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man. Abide with me."
815,asv,"And Jacob served seven years for Rachel. And they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her."
816,asv,"And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her."
817,asv,"And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast."
818,asv,"And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. And he went in unto her."
819,asv,And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid.
820,asv,"And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah. And he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? Did not I serve with thee for Rachel? Wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?"
821,asv,"And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the first-born."
822,asv,"Fulfil the week of this one, and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years."
823,asv,"And jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. And he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife."
824,asv,And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid.
825,asv,"And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years."
826,asv,"And Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb. But Rachel was barren."
827,asv,"And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben. For she said, Because Jehovah hath looked upon my affliction. For now my husband will love me."
828,asv,"And she conceived again, and bare a son: and said, Because Jehovah hath heard that I am hated, he hath therefore given me this `son' also. And she called his name Simeon."
829,asv,"And she conceived again, and bare a son. And said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore was his name called Levi."
830,asv,"And she conceived again, and bare a son. And she said, This time will I praise Jehovah. Therefore she called his name Judah. And she left off bearing."
831,asv,"And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and she said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die."
832,asv,"And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?"
833,asv,"And she said, Behold, my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; that she may bear upon my knees, and I also may obtain children by her."
834,asv,And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.
835,asv,"And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son."
836,asv,"And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan."
837,asv,"And Bilhah Rachel's handmaid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son."
838,asv,"And Rachel said, With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali."
839,asv,"When Leah saw that she had left off bearing, she took Zilpah her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob to wife."
840,asv,And Zilpah Leah's handmaid bare Jacob a son.
841,asv,"And Leah said, Fortunate! and she called his name Gad."
842,asv,And Zilpah Leah's handmaid bare Jacob a second son.
843,asv,"And Leah said, Happy am I! for the daughters will call me happy: and she called his name Asher."
844,asv,"And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes."
845,asv,"And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son's mandrakes."
846,asv,"And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for I have surely hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night."
847,asv,"And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob a fifth son."
848,asv,"And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband: and she called his name Issachar."
849,asv,"And Leah conceived again, and bare a sixth son to Jacob."
850,asv,"And Leah said, God hath endowed me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun."
851,asv,"And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah."
852,asv,"And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb."
853,asv,"And she conceived, and bare a son: and said, God hath taken away my reproach:"
854,asv,"and she called his name Joseph, saying, Jehovah add to me another son."
855,asv,"And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country."
856,asv,"Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service wherewith I have served thee."
857,asv,"And Laban said unto him, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, `tarry': `for' I have divined that Jehovah hath blessed me for thy sake."
858,asv,"And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it."
859,asv,"And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle have fared with me."
860,asv,"For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it hath increased unto a multitude; and Jehovah hath blessed thee whithersoever I turned: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?"
861,asv,"And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me aught: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed thy flock and keep it."
862,asv,"I will pass through all thy flock to-day, removing from thence every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and `of such' shall be my hire."
863,asv,"So shall my righteousness answer for me hereafter, when thou shalt come concerning my hire that is before thee: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that `if found' with me, shall be counted stolen."
864,asv,"And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word."
865,asv,"And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons;"
866,asv,and he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
867,asv,"And Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane-tree. And peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods."
868,asv,And he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they conceived when they came to drink.
869,asv,"And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted."
870,asv,"And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and put them not unto Laban's flock."
871,asv,"And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;"
872,asv,"but when the flock were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's."
873,asv,"And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maid-servants and men-servants, and camels and asses."
874,asv,"And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory."
875,asv,"And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as beforetime."
876,asv,"And Jehovah said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee."
877,asv,"And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,"
878,asv,"and said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as beforetime; but the God of my father hath been with me."
879,asv,And ye know that will all my power I have served your father.
880,asv,"And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me."
881,asv,"If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the flock bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstreaked shall be thy wages; then bare all the flock ringstreaked."
882,asv,"Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me."
883,asv,"And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceive, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled."
884,asv,"And the angel of God said unto me in the dream, Jacob: and I said, Here am I."
885,asv,"And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the he-goats which leap upon the flock are ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee."
886,asv,"I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy nativity."
887,asv,"And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?"
888,asv,"Are we not accounted by him as foreigners? for he hath sold us, and hath also quite devoured our money."
889,asv,"For all the riches which God hath taken away from our father, that is ours and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do."
890,asv,"Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon the camels;"
891,asv,"and he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father unto the land of Canaan."
892,asv,Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father's.
893,asv,"And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled."
894,asv,"So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead."
895,asv,And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
896,asv,"And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead."
897,asv,"And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said unto him, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
898,asv,And Laban came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain: and Laban with his brethren encamped in the mountain of Gilead.
899,asv,"And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword?"
900,asv,"Wherefore didst thou flee secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp;"
901,asv,and didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now hast thou done foolishly.
902,asv,"It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
903,asv,"And now, `though' thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, `yet' wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?"
904,asv,"And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Lest thou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force."
905,asv,"With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them."
906,asv,"And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two maid-servants; but he found them not. And he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent."
907,asv,"Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the camel's saddle, and sat upon them. And Laban felt about all the tent, but found them not."
908,asv,"And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee; for the manner of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the teraphim."
909,asv,"And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast hotly pursued after me?"
910,asv,"Whereas thou hast felt about all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us two."
911,asv,"These twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flocks have I not eaten."
912,asv,"That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night."
913,asv,"Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from mine eyes."
914,asv,"These twenty years have I been in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock: and thou hast changed my wages ten times."
915,asv,"Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now hadst thou sent me away empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight."
916,asv,"And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children whom they have borne?"
917,asv,"And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee."
918,asv,"And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar."
919,asv,"And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they did eat there by the heap."
920,asv,And Laban called it Jegar-saha-dutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.
921,asv,"And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed:"
922,asv,"and Mizpah, for he said, Jehovah watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another."
923,asv,"If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee."
924,asv,"And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I have set betwixt me and thee."
925,asv,"This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm."
926,asv,"The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the Fear of his father Isaac."
927,asv,"And Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain."
928,asv,"And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed and returned unto his place."
929,asv,"And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him."
930,asv,"And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim."
931,asv,"And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom."
932,asv,"And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now:"
933,asv,"and I have oxen, and asses, `and' flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight."
934,asv,"And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him."
935,asv,"Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;"
936,asv,"and he said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the company which is left shall escape."
937,asv,"And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good:"
938,asv,"I am not worthy of the least of all the lovingkindnesses, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two companies."
939,asv,"Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children."
940,asv,"And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude."
941,asv,"And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:"
942,asv,"two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,"
943,asv,"thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals."
944,asv,"And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove."
945,asv,"And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?"
946,asv,"then thou shalt say `They are' thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, he also is behind us."
947,asv,"And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him;"
948,asv,"and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me."
949,asv,So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company.
950,asv,"And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok."
951,asv,"And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had."
952,asv,And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
953,asv,"And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him."
954,asv,"And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me."
955,asv,"And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob."
956,asv,"And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed."
957,asv,"And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there."
958,asv,"And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, `said he', I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved."
959,asv,"And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped upon his thigh."
960,asv,"Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip."
961,asv,"And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids."
962,asv,"And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost."
963,asv,"And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother."
964,asv,"And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept."
965,asv,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The children whom God hath graciously given thy servant."
966,asv,"Then the handmaids came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves."
967,asv,"And Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves."
968,asv,"And he said, What meanest thou by all this company which I met? And he said, To find favor in the sight of my lord."
969,asv,"And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; let that which thou hast be thine."
970,asv,"And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found favor in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand; forasmuch as I have seen thy face, as one seeth the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me."
971,asv,"Take, I pray thee, my gift that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it."
972,asv,"And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee."
973,asv,"And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young: and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die."
974,asv,"Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come unto my lord unto Seir."
975,asv,"And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find favor in the sight of my lord."
976,asv,So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
977,asv,"And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth."
978,asv,"And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and encamped before the city."
979,asv,"And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of money."
980,asv,"And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-israel."
981,asv,"And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land."
982,asv,"And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her; And he took her, and lay with her, and humbled her."
983,asv,"And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel."
984,asv,"And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife."
985,asv,Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they came.
986,asv,And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.
987,asv,"And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done."
988,asv,"And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you, give her unto him to wife."
989,asv,"And make ye marriages with us; give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you."
990,asv,"And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein."
991,asv,"And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find favor in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give."
992,asv,"Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife."
993,asv,"And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with guile, and spake, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,"
994,asv,"and said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us."
995,asv,"Only on this condition will we consent unto you: if ye will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised;"
996,asv,"then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people."
997,asv,"But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone."
998,asv,"And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son."
999,asv,"And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was honored above all the house of his father."
1000,asv,"And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,"
1001,asv,"These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for, behold, the land is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters."
1002,asv,"Only on this condition will the men consent unto us to dwell with us, to become one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised."
1003,asv,"Shall not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us."
1004,asv,"And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city."
1005,asv,"And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city unawares, and slew all the males."
1006,asv,"And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went forth."
1007,asv,"The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister."
1008,asv,"They took their flocks and their herds and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field;"
1009,asv,"and all their wealth, and all their little ones and their wives, took they captive and made a prey, even all that was in the house."
1010,asv,"And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and, I being few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and smite me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house."
1011,asv,"And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?"
1012,asv,"And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother."
1013,asv,"Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments:"
1014,asv,"and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went."
1015,asv,"And they gave unto Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem."
1016,asv,"And they journeyed: and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob."
1017,asv,"So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (the same is Beth-el), he and all the people that were with him."
1018,asv,"And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el; because there God was revealed unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother."
1019,asv,"And Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried below Beth-el under the oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth."
1020,asv,"And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him."
1021,asv,"And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel."
1022,asv,"And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;"
1023,asv,"and the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land."
1024,asv,And God went up from him in the place where he spake with him.
1025,asv,"And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spake with him, a pillar of stone: and he poured out a drink-offering thereon, and poured oil thereon."
1026,asv,"And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Beth-el."
1027,asv,"And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was still some distance to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor."
1028,asv,"And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; for now thou shalt have another son."
1029,asv,"And it came to pass, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin."
1030,asv,"And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem)."
1031,asv,And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave: the same is the Pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.
1032,asv,"And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder."
1033,asv,"And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:"
1034,asv,"The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun;"
1035,asv,the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;
1036,asv,"and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid: Dan and Naphtali;"
1037,asv,"and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram."
1038,asv,"And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac sojourned."
1039,asv,And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years.
1040,asv,"And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, old and full of days: and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him."
1041,asv,Now these are the generations of Esau (the same is Edom).
1042,asv,"Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,"
1043,asv,"and Basemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebaioth."
1044,asv,And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Basemath bare Reuel;
1045,asv,"and Oholibamah bare Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, that were born unto him in the land of Canaan."
1046,asv,"And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his possessions, which he had gather in the land of Canaan; and went into a land away from his brother Jacob."
1047,asv,For their substance was too great for them to dwell together; and the land of their sojournings could not bear them because of their cattle.
1048,asv,And Esau dwelt in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.
1049,asv,And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:
1050,asv,"these are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau."
1051,asv,"And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz."
1052,asv,"And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these are the sons of Adah, Esau's wife."
1053,asv,"And these are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife."
1054,asv,"And these were the sons of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah."
1055,asv,"These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the first-born of Esau: chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,"
1056,asv,"chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek: these are the chiefs that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Adah."
1057,asv,"And these are the sons of Reuel, Esau's son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah: these are the chiefs that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife."
1058,asv,"And these are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau's wife: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah: these are the chiefs that came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife."
1059,asv,"These are the sons of Esau, and these are their chiefs: the same is Edom."
1060,asv,"These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah,"
1061,asv,"and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan: these are the chiefs that came of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom."
1062,asv,And the children of Lotan were Hori and Heman. And Lotan's sister was Timna.
1063,asv,"And these are the children of Shobal: Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and Onam."
1064,asv,"And these are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah; this is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father."
1065,asv,And these are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah.
1066,asv,And these are the children of Dishon: Hemdan and Eshban and Ithran and Cheran.
1067,asv,These are the children of Ezer: Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan.
1068,asv,These are the children of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
1069,asv,"These are the chiefs that came of the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah,"
1070,asv,"chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan: these are the chiefs that came of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir."
1071,asv,"And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel."
1072,asv,And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom; and the name of his city was Dinhabah.
1073,asv,"And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead."
1074,asv,"And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead."
1075,asv,"And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith."
1076,asv,"And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead."
1077,asv,"And Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth by the River reigned in his stead."
1078,asv,"And Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead."
1079,asv,"And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab."
1080,asv,"And these are the names of the chiefs that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,"
1081,asv,"chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,"
1082,asv,"chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,"
1083,asv,"chief Magdiel, chief Iram: these are the chiefs of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession. This is Esau, the father of the Edomites."
1084,asv,"And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of Canaan."
1085,asv,"These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and he was a lad with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought the evil report of them unto their father."
1086,asv,"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors."
1087,asv,"And his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren; and they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him."
1088,asv,"And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren: and they hated him yet the more."
1089,asv,"And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:"
1090,asv,"for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves came round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf."
1091,asv,"And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? Or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words."
1092,asv,"And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed yet a dream: and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me."
1093,asv,"And he told it to his father, and to his brethren; and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?"
1094,asv,And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the saying in mind.
1095,asv,And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
1096,asv,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Are not thy brethren feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I."
1097,asv,"And he said to him, Go now, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and well with the flock; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem."
1098,asv,"And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?"
1099,asv,"And he said, I am seeking my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding `the flock'."
1100,asv,"And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan."
1101,asv,"And they saw him afar off, and before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him."
1102,asv,"And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh."
1103,asv,"Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, And evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams."
1104,asv,"And Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, Let us not take his life."
1105,asv,"And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him: that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father."
1106,asv,"And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him;"
1107,asv,"and they took him, and cast him into the pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it."
1108,asv,"And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt."
1109,asv,"And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood?"
1110,asv,"Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brethren hearkened unto him."
1111,asv,"And there passed by Midianites, merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt."
1112,asv,"And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes."
1113,asv,"And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?"
1114,asv,"And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the blood;"
1115,asv,"and they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, This have we found: know now whether it is thy son's coat or not."
1116,asv,"And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat: an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces."
1117,asv,"And Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days."
1118,asv,"And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning. And his father wept for him."
1119,asv,"And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard."
1120,asv,"And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah."
1121,asv,"And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. And he took her, and went in unto her."
1122,asv,"And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er."
1123,asv,"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan."
1124,asv,"And she yet again bare a son, and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him."
1125,asv,"And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, and her name was Tamar."
1126,asv,"And Er, Judah's first-born, was wicked in the sight of Jehovah. And Jehovah slew him."
1127,asv,"And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother unto her, and raise up seed to thy brother."
1128,asv,"And Onan knew that the seed would not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother."
1129,asv,And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and he slew him also.
1130,asv,"Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown up; for he said, Lest he also die, like his brethren. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house."
1131,asv,"And in process of time Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheep-shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite."
1132,asv,"And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep."
1133,asv,"And she put off from her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given unto him to wife."
1134,asv,"When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; for she had covered her face."
1135,asv,"And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee: for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?"
1136,asv,"And he said, I will send thee a kid of the goats from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?"
1137,asv,"And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet and thy cord, and thy staff that is in thy hand. And he gave them to her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him."
1138,asv,"And she arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood."
1139,asv,"And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not."
1140,asv,"Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the wayside? And they said, There hath been no prostitute here."
1141,asv,"And he returned to Judah, and said, I have not found her; and also the men of the place said, There hath been no prostitute here."
1142,asv,"And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be put to shame: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her."
1143,asv,"And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and moreover, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt."
1144,asv,"When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and the cords, and the staff."
1145,asv,"And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She is more righteous than I; forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more."
1146,asv,"And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb."
1147,asv,"And it came to pass, when she travailed, that one put out a hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first."
1148,asv,"And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, Wherefore hast thou made a breach for thyself? Therefore his name was called Perez."
1149,asv,"And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zerah."
1150,asv,"And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hand of the Ishmaelites, that had brought him down thither."
1151,asv,"And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian."
1152,asv,"And his master saw that Jehovah was with him, and that Jehovah made all that he did to prosper in his hand."
1153,asv,"And Joseph found favor in his sight, and he ministered unto him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand."
1154,asv,"And it came to pass from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that Jehovah blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of Jehovah was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field."
1155,asv,"And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not aught `that was' with him, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was comely, and well-favored."
1156,asv,"And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me."
1157,asv,"But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master knoweth not what is with me in the house, and he hath put all that he hath into my hand:"
1158,asv,"he is not greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back anything from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"
1159,asv,"And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, `or' to be with her."
1160,asv,"And it came to pass about this time, that he went into the house to do his work; and there was none of the men of the house there within."
1161,asv,"And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out."
1162,asv,"And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,"
1163,asv,"that she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us: he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:"
1164,asv,"and it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled, and got him out."
1165,asv,"And she laid up his garment by her, until his master came home."
1166,asv,"And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, whom thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:"
1167,asv,"and it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled out."
1168,asv,"And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled."
1169,asv,"And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison."
1170,asv,"But Jehovah was with Joseph, and showed kindness unto him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison."
1171,asv,"And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it."
1172,asv,"The keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand, because Jehovah was with him; and that which he did, Jehovah made it prosper."
1173,asv,"And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt."
1174,asv,"And Pharaoh was wroth against his two officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers."
1175,asv,"And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound."
1176,asv,"And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he ministered unto them: and they continued a season in ward."
1177,asv,"And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison."
1178,asv,"And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and saw them, and, behold, they were sad."
1179,asv,"And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in ward in his master's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sad to-day?"
1180,asv,"And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell it me, I pray you."
1181,asv,"And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;"
1182,asv,"and in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, `and' its blossoms shot forth; `and' the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:"
1183,asv,"and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand."
1184,asv,"And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days;"
1185,asv,"within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee unto thine office: and thou shalt give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler."
1186,asv,"But have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:"
1187,asv,for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
1188,asv,"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head:"
1189,asv,and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.
1190,asv,"And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: the three baskets are three days;"
1191,asv,"within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee."
1192,asv,"And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants."
1193,asv,And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:
1194,asv,but he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
1195,asv,"Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him."
1196,asv,"And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river."
1197,asv,"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, well-favored and fat-fleshed; and they fed in the reed-grass."
1198,asv,"And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed, and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river."
1199,asv,And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven well-favored and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
1200,asv,"And he slept and dreamed a second time: and, behold, seven ears of grain came up upon one stalk, rank and good."
1201,asv,"And, behold, seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them."
1202,asv,"And the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream."
1203,asv,"And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh."
1204,asv,"Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:"
1205,asv,"Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker:"
1206,asv,"and we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream."
1207,asv,"And there was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret."
1208,asv,"And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged."
1209,asv,"Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh."
1210,asv,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it."
1211,asv,"And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace."
1212,asv,"And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of the river:"
1213,asv,"and, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fat-fleshed and well-favored: and they fed in the reed-grass:"
1214,asv,"and, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill-favored and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:"
1215,asv,and the lean and ill-favored kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
1216,asv,"and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke."
1217,asv,"And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up upon one stalk, full and good:"
1218,asv,"and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, `and' blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:"
1219,asv,and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears: and I told it unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.
1220,asv,"And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: what God is about to do he hath declared unto Pharaoh."
1221,asv,The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.
1222,asv,"And the seven lean and ill-favored kine that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind; they shall be seven years of famine."
1223,asv,That is the thing which I spake unto Pharaoh: what God is about to do he hath showed unto Pharaoh.
1224,asv,"Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:"
1225,asv,and there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
1226,asv,and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine which followeth; for it shall be very grievous.
1227,asv,"And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh, it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass."
1228,asv,"Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt."
1229,asv,"Let Pharaoh do `this', and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years."
1230,asv,"And let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it."
1231,asv,"And the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine."
1232,asv,"And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants."
1233,asv,"And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom the spirit of God is?"
1234,asv,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath showed thee all of this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou:"
1235,asv,"thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou."
1236,asv,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt."
1237,asv,"And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;"
1238,asv,"and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he set him over all the land of Egypt."
1239,asv,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt."
1240,asv,"And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt."
1241,asv,"And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt."
1242,asv,And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
1243,asv,"And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same."
1244,asv,"And Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left off numbering; for it was without number."
1245,asv,"And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bare unto him."
1246,asv,"And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh: For, `said he', God hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house."
1247,asv,And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.
1248,asv,"And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end."
1249,asv,"And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said: and there was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread."
1250,asv,"And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do."
1251,asv,"And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the store-houses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine was sore in the land of Egypt."
1252,asv,"And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was sore in all the earth."
1253,asv,"Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?"
1254,asv,"And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die."
1255,asv,And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy grain from Egypt.
1256,asv,"But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest Peradventure harm befall him."
1257,asv,And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
1258,asv,"And Joseph was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth."
1259,asv,"And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly with them; and he said unto them. Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food."
1260,asv,"And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him."
1261,asv,"And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come."
1262,asv,"And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come."
1263,asv,"We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies."
1264,asv,"And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come."
1265,asv,"And they said, We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not."
1266,asv,"And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:"
1267,asv,"hereby ye shall be proved: by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither."
1268,asv,"Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be bound, that your words may be proved, whether there be truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies."
1269,asv,And he put them all together into ward three days.
1270,asv,"And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live: for I fear God:"
1271,asv,"if ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in your prison-house; but go ye, carry grain for the famine of your houses:"
1272,asv,"and bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so."
1273,asv,"And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us."
1274,asv,"And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is required."
1275,asv,And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.
1276,asv,"And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spake to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes."
1277,asv,"Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with grain, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provisions for the way: and thus was it done unto them."
1278,asv,"And they laded their asses with their grain, and departed thence."
1279,asv,"And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodging-place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack."
1280,asv,"And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that God hath done unto us?"
1281,asv,"And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying,"
1282,asv,"The man, the lord of the land, spake roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country."
1283,asv,"And we said unto him, We are true men; and we are no spies:"
1284,asv,"we are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan."
1285,asv,"And the man, the lord of the land, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men: leave one of your brethren with me, and take `grain for' the famine of your houses, and go your way;"
1286,asv,"and bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffic in the land."
1287,asv,"And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid."
1288,asv,"And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me."
1289,asv,"And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again."
1290,asv,"And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left: if harm befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol."
1291,asv,And the famine was sore in the land.
1292,asv,"And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food."
1293,asv,"And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you."
1294,asv,"If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:"
1295,asv,"but if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down; for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you."
1296,asv,"And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?"
1297,asv,"And they said, The man asked straitly concerning ourselves, and concerning our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye `another' brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we in any wise know that he would say, Bring your brother down?"
1298,asv,"And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones."
1299,asv,"I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:"
1300,asv,"for except we had lingered, surely we had now returned a second time."
1301,asv,"And their father Israel said unto them, If it be so now, do this: take of the choice fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spicery and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;"
1302,asv,and take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:
1303,asv,"take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:"
1304,asv,"and God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release unto you your other brother and Benjamin. And if I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."
1305,asv,"And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph."
1306,asv,"And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, Bring the men into the house, and slay, and make ready; for the men shall dine with me at noon."
1307,asv,And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men to Joseph's house.
1308,asv,"And the men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses."
1309,asv,"And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spake unto him at the door of the house,"
1310,asv,"and said, Oh, my lord, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:"
1311,asv,"and it came to pass, when we came to the lodging-place, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand."
1312,asv,And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food: we know not who put our money in our sacks.
1313,asv,"And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them."
1314,asv,"And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. And he gave their asses provender."
1315,asv,And they made ready the present against Joseph's coming at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
1316,asv,"And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down themselves to him to the earth."
1317,asv,"And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?"
1318,asv,"And they said, Thy servant our father is well, he is yet alive. And they bowed the head, and made obeisance."
1319,asv,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son."
1320,asv,"And Joseph made haste; for his heart yearned over his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there."
1321,asv,"And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said, Set on bread."
1322,asv,"And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, that did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians."
1323,asv,"And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one with another."
1324,asv,"And he took `and sent' messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him."
1325,asv,"And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth."
1326,asv,"And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his grain money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken."
1327,asv,"As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses."
1328,asv,"`And' when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?"
1329,asv,"Is not this that in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing."
1330,asv,"And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these words."
1331,asv,"And they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing."
1332,asv,"Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?"
1333,asv,"With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen."
1334,asv,"And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless."
1335,asv,"Then they hasted, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack."
1336,asv,"And he searched, `and' began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack."
1337,asv,"Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city."
1338,asv,And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; and he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.
1339,asv,"And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I can indeed divine?"
1340,asv,"And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found."
1341,asv,"And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father."
1342,asv,"Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh, my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh."
1343,asv,"My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?"
1344,asv,"And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loveth him."
1345,asv,"And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him."
1346,asv,"And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die."
1347,asv,"And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more."
1348,asv,"And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord."
1349,asv,"And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food."
1350,asv,"And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, expect our youngest brother be with us."
1351,asv,"And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:"
1352,asv,"and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since:"
1353,asv,"and if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol."
1354,asv,"Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;"
1355,asv,"it will come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not `with us', that he will die: and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol."
1356,asv,"For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever."
1357,asv,"Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren."
1358,asv,"For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I see the evil that shall come on my father."
1359,asv,"Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood before him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren."
1360,asv,"And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard."
1361,asv,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence."
1362,asv,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt."
1363,asv,"And now be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life."
1364,asv,"For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and there are yet five years, in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest."
1365,asv,"And God sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance."
1366,asv,"So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt."
1367,asv,"Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not;"
1368,asv,"and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:"
1369,asv,"and there will I nourish thee; for there are yet five years of famine; lest thou come to poverty, thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast."
1370,asv,"And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you."
1371,asv,"And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen: and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither."
1372,asv,"And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck."
1373,asv,"And he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him."
1374,asv,"And the report thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants."
1375,asv,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye: lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;"
1376,asv,"and take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land."
1377,asv,"Now thou art commanded, this do ye: take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come."
1378,asv,Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.
1379,asv,"And the sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way."
1380,asv,"To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment."
1381,asv,"And to his father he sent after this manner: ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way."
1382,asv,"So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way."
1383,asv,"And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father."
1384,asv,"And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he believed them not."
1385,asv,"And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:"
1386,asv,"and Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die."
1387,asv,"And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac."
1388,asv,"And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I."
1389,asv,"And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:"
1390,asv,I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
1391,asv,"And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him."
1392,asv,"And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:"
1393,asv,"his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons's daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt."
1394,asv,"And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's first-born."
1395,asv,"And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi."
1396,asv,"And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman."
1397,asv,"And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
1398,asv,"And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul."
1399,asv,"And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puvah, and Iob, and Shimron."
1400,asv,"And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel."
1401,asv,"These are the sons of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three."
1402,asv,"And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli."
1403,asv,"And the sons of Asher: Imnah, and Ishvah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and Serah their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber, and Malchiel."
1404,asv,"These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls."
1405,asv,The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin.
1406,asv,"And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On, bare unto him."
1407,asv,"And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard."
1408,asv,"These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen."
1409,asv,And the sons of Dan: Hushim.
1410,asv,"And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem."
1411,asv,"These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob: all the souls were seven."
1412,asv,"All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, that came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six;"
1413,asv,"and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were threescore and ten."
1414,asv,"And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to show the way before him unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen."
1415,asv,"And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and he presented himself unto him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while."
1416,asv,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, that thou art yet alive."
1417,asv,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and will say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;"
1418,asv,"and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have."
1419,asv,"And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?"
1420,asv,"that ye shall say, Thy servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians."
1421,asv,"Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen."
1422,asv,"And from among his brethren he took five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh."
1423,asv,"And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers."
1424,asv,"And they said unto Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land are we come; for there is no pasture for thy servants' flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen."
1425,asv,"And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:"
1426,asv,"the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and thy brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle."
1427,asv,"And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh."
1428,asv,"And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How many are the days of the years of thy life?"
1429,asv,"And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage."
1430,asv,"And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh."
1431,asv,"And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded."
1432,asv,"And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families."
1433,asv,"And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine."
1434,asv,"And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house."
1435,asv,"And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for `our' money faileth."
1436,asv,"And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail."
1437,asv,"And they brought their cattle unto Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year."
1438,asv,"And when that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lord's; there is nought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:"
1439,asv,"wherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not desolate."
1440,asv,"So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine was sore upon them: and the land became Pharaoh's."
1441,asv,"And as for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end thereof."
1442,asv,"Only the land of the priests bought he not: for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them; wherefore they sold not their land."
1443,asv,"Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land."
1444,asv,"And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones."
1445,asv,"And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants."
1446,asv,"And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone became not Pharaoh's."
1447,asv,"And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they gat them possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly."
1448,asv,"And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred forty and seven years."
1449,asv,"And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt;"
1450,asv,"but when I sleep with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as thou hast said."
1451,asv,"And he said, Swear unto me: and he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head."
1452,asv,"And it came to pass after these things, that one said to Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim."
1453,asv,"And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed."
1454,asv,"And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,"
1455,asv,"and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples, and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession."
1456,asv,"And now thy two sons, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine."
1457,asv,"And thy issue, that thou begettest after them, shall be thine; they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance."
1458,asv,"And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was still some distance to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem)."
1459,asv,"And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?"
1460,asv,"And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me here. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them."
1461,asv,"Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them."
1462,asv,"And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath let me see thy seed also."
1463,asv,And Joseph brought them out from between his knees; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
1464,asv,"And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him."
1465,asv,"And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the first-born."
1466,asv,"And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who hath fed me all my life long unto this day,"
1467,asv,"the angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."
1468,asv,"And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head."
1469,asv,"And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father; for this is the first-born; put thy right hand upon his head."
1470,asv,"And his father refused, and said, I know `it', my son, I know `it'. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: howbeit his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations."
1471,asv,"And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee will Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh."
1472,asv,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God will be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers."
1473,asv,"Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow."
1474,asv,"And Jacob called unto his sons, and said: gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the latter days."
1475,asv,"Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; And hearken unto Israel your father."
1476,asv,"Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength; The pre-eminence of dignity, and the pre-eminence of power."
1477,asv,"Boiling over as water, thou shalt not have the pre-eminence; Because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; Then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch."
1478,asv,Simeon and Levi are brethren; Weapons of violence are their swords.
1479,asv,"O my soul, come not thou into their council; Unto their assembly, my glory, be not thou united; For in their anger they slew a man, And in their self-will they hocked an ox."
1480,asv,"Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; And their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, And scatter them in Israel."
1481,asv,"Judah, thee shall thy brethren praise: Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies; Thy father's sons shall bow down before thee."
1482,asv,"Judah is a lion's whelp; From the prey, my son, thou art gone up: He stooped down, he couched as a lion, And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?"
1483,asv,"The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, Until Shiloh come: And unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be."
1484,asv,"Binding his foal unto the vine, And his ass's colt unto the choice vine; He hath washed his garments in wine, And his vesture in the blood of grapes:"
1485,asv,"His eyes shall be red with wine, And his teeth white with milk."
1486,asv,Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; And he shall be for a haven of ships; And his border shall be upon Sidon.
1487,asv,"Issachar is a strong ass, Couching down between the sheepfolds:"
1488,asv,"And he saw a resting-place that it was good, And the land that it was pleasant; And he bowed his shoulder to bear, And became a servant under taskwork."
1489,asv,"Dan shall judge his people, As one of the tribes of Israel."
1490,asv,"Dan shall be a serpent in the way, An adder in the path, That biteth the horse's heels, So that his rider falleth backward."
1491,asv,"I have waited for thy salvation, O Jehovah."
1492,asv,"Gad, a troop shall press upon him; But he shall press upon their heel."
1493,asv,"Out of the Asher his bread shall be fat, And he shall yield royal dainties."
1494,asv,Naphtali is a hind let loose: He giveth goodly words.
1495,asv,"Joseph is a fruitful bough, A fruitful bough by a fountain; His branches run over the wall."
1496,asv,"The archers have sorely grieved him, And shot at him, and persecute him:"
1497,asv,"But his bow abode in strength, And the arms of his hands were made strong, By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, (From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel),"
1498,asv,"Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, And by the Almighty, who shall bless thee, With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath, Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb."
1499,asv,"The blessings of thy father Have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors Unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: They shall be on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren."
1500,asv,"Benjamin is a wolf that raveneth: In the morning she shall devour the prey, And at even he shall divide the spoil."
1501,asv,All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.
1502,asv,"And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,"
1503,asv,"in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burying-place."
1504,asv,there they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah:
1505,asv,"the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth."
1506,asv,"And when Jacob made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people."
1507,asv,"And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him."
1508,asv,And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
1509,asv,And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of embalming: and the Egyptians wept for him three-score and ten days.
1510,asv,"And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found favor in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,"
1511,asv,"My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again."
1512,asv,"And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear."
1513,asv,"And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,"
1514,asv,"and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen."
1515,asv,And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
1516,asv,"And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days."
1517,asv,"And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan."
1518,asv,And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:
1519,asv,"for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession of a burying-place, of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre."
1520,asv,"And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father."
1521,asv,"And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully requite us all the evil which we did unto him."
1522,asv,"And they sent a message unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,"
1523,asv,"So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin, for that they did unto thee evil. And now, we pray thee, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him."
1524,asv,"And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we are thy servants."
1525,asv,"And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?"
1526,asv,"And as for you, ye meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive."
1527,asv,"Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them."
1528,asv,"And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years."
1529,asv,And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph's knees.
1530,asv,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die; but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
1531,asv,"And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence."
1532,asv,"So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt."
1533,bbe,At the first God made the heaven and the earth.
1534,bbe,And the earth was waste and without form; and it was dark on the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God was moving on the face of the waters.
1535,bbe,"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light."
1536,bbe,"And God, looking on the light, saw that it was good: and God made a division between the light and the dark,"
1537,bbe,"Naming the light, Day, and the dark, Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day."
1538,bbe,"And God said, Let there be a solid arch stretching over the waters, parting the waters from the waters."
1539,bbe,And God made the arch for a division between the waters which were under the arch and those which were over it: and it was so.
1540,bbe,"And God gave the arch the name of Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day."
1541,bbe,"And God said, Let the waters under the heaven come together in one place, and let the dry land be seen: and it was so."
1542,bbe,And God gave the dry land the name of Earth; and the waters together in their place were named Seas: and God saw that it was good.
1543,bbe,"And God said, Let grass come up on the earth, and plants producing seed, and fruit-trees giving fruit, in which is their seed, after their sort: and it was so."
1544,bbe,"And grass came up on the earth, and every plant producing seed of its sort, and every tree producing fruit, in which is its seed, of its sort: and God saw that it was good."
1545,bbe,"And there was evening and there was morning, the third day."
1546,bbe,"And God said, Let there be lights in the arch of heaven, for a division between the day and the night, and let them be for signs, and for marking the changes of the year, and for days and for years:"
1547,bbe,And let them be for lights in the arch of heaven to give light on the earth: and it was so.
1548,bbe,"And God made the two great lights: the greater light to be the ruler of the day, and the smaller light to be the ruler of the night: and he made the stars."
1549,bbe,"And God put them in the arch of heaven, to give light on the earth;"
1550,bbe,"To have rule over the day and the night, and for a division between the light and the dark: and God saw that it was good."
1551,bbe,"And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day."
1552,bbe,"And God said, Let the waters be full of living things, and let birds be in flight over the earth under the arch of heaven."
1553,bbe,"And God made great sea-beasts, and every sort of living and moving thing with which the waters were full, and every sort of winged bird: and God saw that it was good."
1554,bbe,"And God gave them his blessing, saying, Be fertile and have increase, making all the waters of the seas full, and let the birds be increased in the earth."
1555,bbe,"And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day."
1556,bbe,"And God said, Let the earth give birth to all sorts of living things, cattle and all things moving on the earth, and beasts of the earth after their sort: and it was so."
1557,bbe,"And God made the beast of the earth after its sort, and the cattle after their sort, and everything moving on the face of the earth after its sort: and God saw that it was good."
1558,bbe,"And God said, Let us make man in our image, like us: and let him have rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every living thing which goes flat on the earth."
1559,bbe,"And God made man in his image, in the image of God he made him: male and female he made them."
1560,bbe,"And God gave them his blessing and said to them, Be fertile and have increase, and make the earth full and be masters of it; be rulers over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing moving on the earth."
1561,bbe,"And God said, See, I have given you every plant producing seed, on the face of all the earth, and every tree which has fruit producing seed: they will be for your food:"
1562,bbe,And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the air and every living thing moving on the face of the earth I have given every green plant for food: and it was so.
1563,bbe,"And God saw everything which he had made and it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day."
1564,bbe,And the heaven and the earth and all things in them were complete.
1565,bbe,And on the seventh day God came to the end of all his work; and on the seventh day he took his rest from all the work which he had done.
1566,bbe,And God gave his blessing to the seventh day and made it holy: because on that day he took his rest from all the work which he had made and done.
1567,bbe,These are the generations of the heaven and the earth when they were made.
1568,bbe,"In the day when the Lord God made earth and heaven there were no plants of the field on the earth, and no grass had come up: for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no man to do work on the land."
1569,bbe,"But a mist went up from the earth, watering all the face of the land."
1570,bbe,"And the Lord God made man from the dust of the earth, breathing into him the breath of life: and man became a living soul."
1571,bbe,"And the Lord God made a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had made."
1572,bbe,"And out of the earth the Lord made every tree to come, delighting the eye and good for food; and in the middle of the garden, the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil."
1573,bbe,And a river went out of Eden giving water to the garden; and from there it was parted and became four streams.
1574,bbe,"The name of the first is Pishon, which goes round about all the land of Havilah where there is gold."
1575,bbe,And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
1576,bbe,And the name of the second river is Gihon: this river goes round all the land of Cush.
1577,bbe,"And the name of the third river is Tigris, which goes to the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates."
1578,bbe,And the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to do work in it and take care of it.
1579,bbe,"And the Lord God gave the man orders, saying, You may freely take of the fruit of every tree of the garden:"
1580,bbe,"But of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you may not take; for on the day when you take of it, death will certainly come to you."
1581,bbe,"And the Lord God said, It is not good for the man to be by himself: I will make one like himself as a help to him"
1582,bbe,"And from the earth the Lord God made every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and took them to the man to see what names he would give them: and whatever name he gave to any living thing, that was its name."
1583,bbe,And the man gave names to all cattle and to the birds of the air and to every beast of the field; but Adam had no one like himself as a help.
1584,bbe,"And the Lord God sent a deep sleep on the man, and took one of the bones from his side while he was sleeping, joining up the flesh again in its place:"
1585,bbe,"And the bone which the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman, and took her to the man."
1586,bbe,"And the man said, This is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh: let her name be Woman because she was taken out of Man."
1587,bbe,For this cause will a man go away from his father and his mother and be joined to his wife; and they will be one flesh.
1588,bbe,"And the man and his wife were without clothing, and they had no sense of shame."
1589,bbe,"Now the snake was wiser than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman, Has God truly said that you may not take of the fruit of any tree in the garden?"
1590,bbe,"And the woman said, We may take of the fruit of the trees in the garden:"
1591,bbe,"But of the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God has said, If you take of it or put your hands on it, death will come to you."
1592,bbe,"And the snake said, Death will not certainly come to you:"
1593,bbe,"For God sees that on the day when you take of its fruit, your eyes will be open, and you will be as gods, having knowledge of good and evil."
1594,bbe,"And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and a delight to the eyes, and to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit, and gave it to her husband."
1595,bbe,And their eyes were open and they were conscious that they had no clothing and they made themselves coats of leaves stitched together.
1596,bbe,"And there came to them the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the evening wind: and the man and his wife went to a secret place among the trees of the garden, away from the eyes of the Lord God."
1597,bbe,"And the voice of the Lord God came to the man, saying, Where are you?"
1598,bbe,"And he said, Hearing your voice in the garden I was full of fear, because I was without clothing: and I kept myself from your eyes."
1599,bbe,"And he said, Who gave you the knowledge that you were without clothing? Have you taken of the fruit of the tree which I said you were not to take?"
1600,bbe,"And the man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me the fruit of the tree and I took it."
1601,bbe,"And the Lord God said to the woman, What have you done? And the woman said, I was tricked by the deceit of the snake and I took it."
1602,bbe,"And the Lord God said to the snake, Because you have done this you are cursed more than all cattle and every beast of the field; you will go flat on the earth, and dust will be your food all the days of your life:"
1603,bbe,And there will be war between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed: by him will your head be crushed and by you his foot will be wounded.
1604,bbe,"To the woman he said, Great will be your pain in childbirth; in sorrow will your children come to birth; still your desire will be for your husband, but he will be your master."
1605,bbe,"And to Adam he said, Because you gave ear to the voice of your wife and took of the fruit of the tree which I said you were not to take, the earth is cursed on your account; in pain you will get your food from it all your life."
1606,bbe,"Thorns and waste plants will come up, and the plants of the field will be your food;"
1607,bbe,With the hard work of your hands you will get your bread till you go back to the earth from which you were taken: for dust you are and to the dust you will go back.
1608,bbe,And the man gave his wife the name of Eve because she was the mother of all who have life.
1609,bbe,And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins for their clothing.
1610,bbe,"And the Lord God said, Now the man has become like one of us, having knowledge of good and evil; and now if he puts out his hand and takes of the fruit of the tree of life, he will go on living for ever."
1611,bbe,So the Lord God sent him out of the garden of Eden to be a worker on the earth from which he was taken.
1612,bbe,So he sent the man out; and at the east of the garden of Eden he put winged ones and a flaming sword turning every way to keep the way to the tree of life.
1613,bbe,"And the man had connection with Eve his wife, and she became with child and gave birth to Cain, and said, I have got a man from the Lord."
1614,bbe,"Then again she became with child and gave birth to Abel, his brother. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a farmer."
1615,bbe,"And after a time, Cain gave to the Lord an offering of the fruits of the earth."
1616,bbe,And Abel gave an offering of the young lambs of his flock and of their fat. And the Lord was pleased with Abel's offering;
1617,bbe,But in Cain and his offering he had no pleasure. And Cain was angry and his face became sad.
1618,bbe,"And the Lord said to Cain, Why are you angry? and why is your face sad?"
1619,bbe,"If you do well, will you not have honour? and if you do wrong, sin is waiting at the door, desiring to have you, but do not let it be your master."
1620,bbe,"And Cain said to his brother, Let us go into the field: and when they were in the field, Cain made an attack on his brother Abel and put him to death."
1621,bbe,"And the Lord said to Cain, Where is your brother Abel? And he said, I have no idea: am I my brother's keeper?"
1622,bbe,"And he said, What have you done? the voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from the earth."
1623,bbe,"And now you are cursed from the earth, whose mouth is open to take your brother's blood from your hand;"
1624,bbe,No longer will the earth give you her fruit as the reward of your work; you will be a wanderer in flight over the earth.
1625,bbe,"And Cain said, My punishment is greater than my strength."
1626,bbe,"You have sent me out this day from the face of the earth and from before your face; I will be a wanderer in flight over the earth, and whoever sees me will put me to death."
1627,bbe,"And the Lord said, Truly, if Cain is put to death, seven lives will be taken for his. And the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one might put him to death."
1628,bbe,"And Cain went away from before the face of the Lord, and made his living-place in the land of Nod on the east of Eden."
1629,bbe,"And Cain had connection with his wife and she became with child and gave birth to Enoch: and he made a town, and gave the town the name of Enoch after his son."
1630,bbe,And Enoch had a son Irad: and Irad became the father of Mehujael: and Mehujael became the father of Methushael: and Methushael became the father of Lamech.
1631,bbe,"And Lamech had two wives; the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah."
1632,bbe,And Adah gave birth to Jabal: he was the father of such as are living in tents and keep cattle.
1633,bbe,And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all players on instruments of music.
1634,bbe,"And Zillah gave birth to Tubal-cain, who is the father of every maker of cutting instruments of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah."
1635,bbe,"And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, give ear to my voice; you wives of Lamech, give attention to my words, for I would put a man to death for a wound, and a young man for a blow;"
1636,bbe,"If seven lives are to be taken as punishment for Cain's death, seventy-seven will be taken for Lamech's."
1637,bbe,"And Adam had connection with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son to whom she gave the name of Seth: for she said, God has given me another seed in place of Abel, whom Cain put to death."
1638,bbe,"And Seth had a son, and he gave him the name of Enosh: at this time men first made use of the name of the Lord in worship."
1639,bbe,"This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day when God made man, he made him in the image of God;"
1640,bbe,"Male and female he made them, naming them Man, and giving them his blessing on the day when they were made."
1641,bbe,"Adam had been living for a hundred and thirty years when he had a son like himself, after his image, and gave him the name of Seth:"
1642,bbe,"And after the birth of Seth, Adam went on living for eight hundred years, and had sons and daughters:"
1643,bbe,And all the years of Adam's life were nine hundred and thirty: and he came to his end.
1644,bbe,And Seth was a hundred and five years old when he became the father of Enosh:
1645,bbe,"And he went on living after the birth of Enosh for eight hundred and seven years, and had sons and daughters:"
1646,bbe,And all the years of Seth's life were nine hundred and twelve: and he came to his end.
1647,bbe,And Enosh was ninety years old when he became the father of Kenan:
1648,bbe,"And after the birth of Kenan, Enosh went on living for eight hundred and fifteen years, and had sons and daughters:"
1649,bbe,And all the years of Enosh were nine hundred and five: and he came to his end.
1650,bbe,And Kenan was seventy years old when he became the father of Mahalalel:
1651,bbe,"And after the birth of Mahalalel, Kenan went on living for eight hundred and forty years, and had sons and daughters:"
1652,bbe,And all the years of Kenan's life were nine hundred and ten; and he came to his end.
1653,bbe,And Mahalalel was sixty-five years old when he became the father of Jared:
1654,bbe,"And after the birth of Jared, Mahalalel went on living for eight hundred and thirty years, and had sons and daughters:"
1655,bbe,And all the years of Mahalalel's life were eight hundred and ninety-five: and he came to his end.
1656,bbe,And Jared was a hundred and sixty-two years old when he became the father of Enoch:
1657,bbe,"And Jared went on living after the birth of Enoch for eight hundred years, and had sons and daughters:"
1658,bbe,And all the years of Jared's life were nine hundred and sixty-two: and he came to his end.
1659,bbe,And Enoch was sixty-five years old when he became the father of Methuselah:
1660,bbe,"And after the birth of Methuselah, Enoch went on in God's ways for three hundred years, and had sons and daughters:"
1661,bbe,And all the years of Enoch's life were three hundred and sixty-five:
1662,bbe,"And Enoch went on in God's ways: and he was not seen again, for God took him."
1663,bbe,And Methuselah was a hundred and eighty-seven years old when he became the father of Lamech:
1664,bbe,"And after the birth of Lamech, Methuselah went on living for seven hundred and eighty-two years, and had sons and daughters:"
1665,bbe,And all the years of Methuselah's life were nine hundred and sixty-nine: and he came to his end.
1666,bbe,And Lamech was a hundred and eighty-two years old when he had a son:
1667,bbe,"And he gave him the name of Noah, saying, Truly, he will give us rest from our trouble and the hard work of our hands, because of the earth which was cursed by God."
1668,bbe,"And after the birth of Noah, Lamech went on living for five hundred and ninety-five years, and had sons and daughters:"
1669,bbe,And all the years of Lamech's life were seven hundred and seventy-seven: and he came to his end.
1670,bbe,"And when Noah was five hundred years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
1671,bbe,"And after a time, when men were increasing on the earth, and had daughters,"
1672,bbe,The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair; and they took wives for themselves from those who were pleasing to them.
1673,bbe,"And the Lord said, My spirit will not be in man for ever, for he is only flesh; so the days of his life will be a hundred and twenty years."
1674,bbe,"There were men of great strength and size on the earth in those days; and after that, when the sons of God had connection with the daughters of men, they gave birth to children: these were the great men of old days, the men of great name."
1675,bbe,"And the Lord saw that the sin of man was great on the earth, and that all the thoughts of his heart were evil."
1676,bbe,"And the Lord had sorrow because he had made man on the earth, and grief was in his heart."
1677,bbe,"And the Lord said, I will take away man, whom I have made, from the face of the earth, even man and beast and that which goes on the earth and every bird of the air; for I have sorrow for having made them."
1678,bbe,But Noah had grace in the eyes of God.
1679,bbe,These are the generations of Noah. Noah was an upright man and without sin in his generation: he went in the ways of God.
1680,bbe,"And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
1681,bbe,And the earth was evil in God's eyes and full of violent ways.
1682,bbe,"And God, looking on the earth, saw that it was evil: for the way of all flesh had become evil on the earth."
1683,bbe,"And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh has come; the earth is full of their violent doings, and now I will put an end to them with the earth."
1684,bbe,"Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood with rooms in it, and make it safe from the water inside and out."
1685,bbe,"And this is the way you are to make it: it is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high."
1686,bbe,"You are to put a window in the ark, a cubit from the roof, and a door in the side of it, and you are to make it with a lower and second and third floors."
1687,bbe,"For truly, I will send a great flow of waters over the earth, for the destruction from under the heaven of all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything on the earth will come to an end."
1688,bbe,"But with you I will make an agreement; and you will come into the ark, you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you."
1689,bbe,"And you will take with you into the ark two of every sort of living thing, and keep them safe with you; they will be male and female."
1690,bbe,Two of every sort of bird and cattle and of every sort of living thing which goes on the earth will you take with you to keep them from destruction.
1691,bbe,And make a store of every sort of food for yourself and them.
1692,bbe,"And all these things Noah did; as God said, so he did."
1693,bbe,"And the Lord said to Noah, Take all your family and go into the ark, for you only in this generation have I seen to be upright."
1694,bbe,"Of every clean beast you will take seven males and seven females, and of the beasts which are not clean, two, the male and his female;"
1695,bbe,"And of the birds of the air, seven males and seven females, so that their seed may still be living on the face of the earth."
1696,bbe,"For after seven days I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, for the destruction of every living thing which I have made on the face of the earth."
1697,bbe,And Noah did everything which the Lord said he was to do.
1698,bbe,And Noah was six hundred years old when the waters came flowing over all the earth.
1699,bbe,"And Noah, with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives, went into the ark because of the flowing of the waters."
1700,bbe,"Of clean beasts, and of beasts which are not clean, and of birds, and of everything which goes on the earth,"
1701,bbe,"In twos, male and female, they went into the ark with Noah, as God had said."
1702,bbe,"And after the seven days, the waters came over all the earth."
1703,bbe,"In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, all the fountains of the great deep came bursting through, and the windows of heaven were open;"
1704,bbe,And rain came down on the earth for forty days and forty nights.
1705,bbe,"On the same day Noah, with Shem, Ham, and Japheth, his sons, and his wife and his sons' wives, went into the ark;"
1706,bbe,"And with them, every sort of beast and cattle, and every sort of thing which goes on the earth, and every sort of bird."
1707,bbe,"They went with Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh in which is the breath of life."
1708,bbe,"Male and female of all flesh went in, as God had said, and the ark was shut by the Lord."
1709,bbe,And for forty days the waters were over all the earth; and the waters were increased so that the ark was lifted up high over the earth.
1710,bbe,"And the waters overcame everything and were increased greatly on the earth, and the ark was resting on the face of the waters."
1711,bbe,And the waters overcame everything on the earth; and all the mountains under heaven were covered.
1712,bbe,"The waters went fifteen cubits higher, till all the mountains were covered."
1713,bbe,"And destruction came on every living thing moving on the earth, birds and cattle and beasts and everything which went on the earth, and every man."
1714,bbe,"Everything on the dry land, in which was the breath of life, came to its end."
1715,bbe,"Every living thing on the face of all the earth, man and cattle and things moving on the face of the earth, and birds of the air, came to destruction: only Noah and those who were with him in the ark, were kept from death."
1716,bbe,And the waters were over the earth a hundred and fifty days.
1717,bbe,"And God kept Noah in mind, and all the living things and the cattle which were with him in the ark: and God sent a wind over the earth, and the waters went down."
1718,bbe,"And the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were shut, and the rain from heaven was stopped."
1719,bbe,"And the waters went slowly back from the earth, and at the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters were lower."
1720,bbe,And on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
1721,bbe,"And still the waters went on falling, till on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains were seen."
1722,bbe,"Then, after forty days, through the open window of the ark which he had made,"
1723,bbe,"Noah sent out a raven, which went this way and that till the waters were gone from the earth."
1724,bbe,"And he sent out a dove, to see if the waters had gone from the face of the earth;"
1725,bbe,"But the dove saw no resting-place for her foot, and came back to the ark, for the waters were still over all the earth; and he put out his hand, and took her into the ark."
1726,bbe,"And after waiting another seven days, he sent the dove out again;"
1727,bbe,"And the dove came back at evening, and in her mouth was an olive-leaf broken off: so Noah was certain that the waters had gone down on the earth."
1728,bbe,"And after seven days more, he sent the dove out again, but she did not come back to him."
1729,bbe,"And in the six hundred and first year, on the first day of the first month, the waters were dry on the earth: and Noah took the cover off the ark and saw that the face of the earth was dry."
1730,bbe,And on the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was dry.
1731,bbe,"And God said to Noah,"
1732,bbe,"Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons' wives."
1733,bbe,"Take out with you every living thing which is with you, birds and cattle and everything which goes on the earth, so that they may have offspring and be fertile and be increased on the earth."
1734,bbe,And Noah went out with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives;
1735,bbe,"And every beast and bird and every living thing of every sort which goes on the earth, went out of the ark."
1736,bbe,"And Noah made an altar to the Lord, and from every clean beast and bird he made burned offerings on the altar."
1737,bbe,"And when the sweet smell came up to the Lord, he said in his heart, I will not again put a curse on the earth because of man, for the thoughts of man's heart are evil from his earliest days; never again will I send destruction on all living things as I have done."
1738,bbe,"While the earth goes on, seed time and the getting in of the grain, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, will not come to an end."
1739,bbe,"And God gave his blessing to Noah and his sons, and said, Be fertile, and have increase, and make the earth full."
1740,bbe,"And the fear of you will be strong in every beast of the earth and every bird of the air; everything which goes on the land, and all the fishes of the sea, are given into your hands."
1741,bbe,Every living and moving thing will be food for you; I give them all to you as before I gave you all green things.
1742,bbe,But flesh with the life-blood in it you may not take for food.
1743,bbe,"And for your blood, which is your life, will I take payment; from every beast I will take it, and from every man will I take payment for the blood of his brother-man."
1744,bbe,"Whoever takes a man's life, by man will his life be taken; because God made man in his image."
1745,bbe,"And now, be fertile and have increase; have offspring on the earth and become great in number."
1746,bbe,"And God said to Noah and to his sons,"
1747,bbe,"Truly, I will make my agreement with you and with your seed after you,"
1748,bbe,"And with every living thing with you, all birds and cattle and every beast of the earth which comes out of the ark with you."
1749,bbe,And I will make my agreement with you; never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters; never again will the waters come over all the earth for its destruction.
1750,bbe,"And God said, This is the sign of the agreement which I make between me and you and every living thing with you, for all future generations:"
1751,bbe,I will put my bow in the cloud and it will be for a sign of the agreement between me and the earth.
1752,bbe,"And whenever I make a cloud come over the earth, the bow will be seen in the cloud,"
1753,bbe,And I will keep in mind the agreement between me and you and every living thing; and never again will there be a great flow of waters causing destruction to all flesh.
1754,bbe,"And the bow will be in the cloud, and looking on it, I will keep in mind the eternal agreement between God and every living thing on the earth."
1755,bbe,"And God said to Noah, This is the sign of the agreement which I have made between me and all flesh on the earth."
1756,bbe,"And the sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and Ham is the father of Canaan."
1757,bbe,These three were the sons of Noah and from them all the earth was peopled.
1758,bbe,"In those days Noah became a farmer, and he made a vine-garden."
1759,bbe,And he took of the wine of it and was overcome by drink; and he was uncovered in his tent.
1760,bbe,"And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father unclothed, and gave news of it to his two brothers outside."
1761,bbe,"And Shem and Japheth took a robe, and putting it on their backs went in with their faces turned away, and put it over their father so that they might not see him unclothed."
1762,bbe,"And, awaking from his wine, Noah saw what his youngest son had done to him, and he said,"
1763,bbe,Cursed be Canaan; let him be a servant of servants to his brothers.
1764,bbe,"And he said, Praise to the Lord, the God of Shem; let Canaan be his servant."
1765,bbe,"May God make Japheth great, and let his living-place be in the tents of Shem, and let Canaan be his servant."
1766,bbe,And Noah went on living three hundred and fifty years after the great flow of waters;
1767,bbe,all the years of his life were nine hundred and fifty: and he came to his end.
1768,bbe,"Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: these are the sons which they had after the great flow of waters"
1769,bbe,The sons of Japheth: Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tubal and Meshech and Tiras.
1770,bbe,And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah.
1771,bbe,"And the sons of Javan: Elishah and Tarshish, the Kittim and the Dodanim."
1772,bbe,"From these came the nations of the sea-lands, with their different families and languages."
1773,bbe,And the sons of Ham: Cush and Mizraim and Put and Canaan.
1774,bbe,And the sons of Cush: Seba and Havilah and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
1775,bbe,"And Cush was the father of Nimrod, who was the first of the great men of the earth."
1776,bbe,"He was a very great bowman, so that there is a saying, Like Nimrod, a very great bowman."
1777,bbe,"And at the first, his kingdom was Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh, in the land of Shinar."
1778,bbe,"From that land he went out into Assyria, building Nineveh with its wide streets and Calah,"
1779,bbe,"And Resen between Nineveh and Calah, which is a very great town."
1780,bbe,And Mizraim was the father of the Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim and Naphtuhim;
1781,bbe,"And Pathrusim and Casluhim and Caphtorim, from whom came the Philistines."
1782,bbe,"And Canaan was the father of Zidon, who was his oldest son, and Heth,"
1783,bbe,"And the Jebusite and the Amorite and the Girgashite,"
1784,bbe,"And the Hivite and the Arkite and the Sinite,"
1785,bbe,And the Arvadite and the Zemarite and the Hamathite; after that the families of the Canaanites went far and wide in all directions;
1786,bbe,"Their country stretching from Zidon to Gaza, in the direction of Gerar; and to Lasha, in the direction of Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim."
1787,bbe,"All these, with their different families, languages, lands, and nations, are the offspring of Ham."
1788,bbe,"And Shem, the older brother of Japheth, the father of the children of Eber, had other sons in addition."
1789,bbe,These are the sons of Shem: Elam and Asshur and Arpachshad and Lud and Aram.
1790,bbe,And the sons of Aram: Uz and Hul and Gether and Mash.
1791,bbe,And Arpachshad became the father of Shelah; and Shelah became the father of Eber.
1792,bbe,"And Eber had two sons: the name of the one was Peleg, because in his time the peoples of the earth became separate; and his brother's name was Joktan."
1793,bbe,And Joktan was the father of Almodad and Sheleph and Hazarmaveth and Jerah
1794,bbe,And Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah
1795,bbe,And Obal and Abimael and Sheba
1796,bbe,And Ophir and Havilah and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.
1797,bbe,"And their country was from Mesha, in the direction of Sephar, the mountain of the east."
1798,bbe,"These, with their families and their languages and their lands and their nations, are the offspring of Shem."
1799,bbe,"These are the families of the sons of Noah, in the order of their generations and their nations: from these came all the nations of the earth after the great flow of waters."
1800,bbe,And all the earth had one language and one tongue.
1801,bbe,"And it came about that in their wandering from the east, they came to a stretch of flat country in the land of Shinar, and there they made their living-place."
1802,bbe,"And they said one to another, Come, let us make bricks, burning them well. And they had bricks for stone, putting them together with sticky earth."
1803,bbe,"And they said, Come, let us make a town, and a tower whose top will go up as high as heaven; and let us make a great name for ourselves, so that we may not be wanderers over the face of the earth."
1804,bbe,And the Lord came down to see the town and the tower which the children of men were building.
1805,bbe,"And the Lord said, See, they are all one people and have all one language; and this is only the start of what they may do: and now it will not be possible to keep them from any purpose of theirs."
1806,bbe,"Come, let us go down and take away the sense of their language, so that they will not be able to make themselves clear to one another."
1807,bbe,So the Lord God sent them away into every part of the earth: and they gave up building their town.
1808,bbe,"So it was named Babel, because there the Lord took away the sense of all languages and from there the Lord sent them away over all the face of the earth."
1809,bbe,"These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old when he became the father of Arpachshad, two years after the great flow of waters;"
1810,bbe,"And after the birth of Arpachshad, Shem went on living for five hundred years, and had sons and daughters:"
1811,bbe,And Arpachshad was thirty-five years old when he became the father of Shelah:
1812,bbe,"And after the birth of Shelah, Arpachshad went on living for four hundred and three years, and had sons and daughters:"
1813,bbe,And Shelah was thirty years old when he became the father of Eber:
1814,bbe,"And after the birth of Eber, Shelah went on living for four hundred and three years, and had sons and daughters:"
1815,bbe,And Eber was thirty-four years old when he became the father of Peleg:
1816,bbe,"And after the birth of Peleg, Eber went on living for four hundred and thirty years, and had sons and daughters:"
1817,bbe,And Peleg was thirty years old when he became the father of Reu:
1818,bbe,"And after the birth of Reu, Peleg went on living for two hundred and nine years, and had sons and daughters:"
1819,bbe,And Reu was thirty-two years old when he became the father of Serug:
1820,bbe,"And after the birth of Serug, Reu went on living for two hundred and seven years, and had sons and daughters:"
1821,bbe,And Serug was thirty years old when he became the father of Nahor:
1822,bbe,"And after the birth of Nahor, Serug went on living for two hundred years, and had sons and daughters:"
1823,bbe,And Nahor was twenty-nine years old when he became the father of Terah:
1824,bbe,"And after the birth of Terah, Nahor went on living for a hundred and nineteen years, and had sons and daughters:"
1825,bbe,"And Terah was seventy years old when he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran."
1826,bbe,"These are the generations of Terah: Terah was the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran was the father of Lot."
1827,bbe,"And death came to Haran when he was with his father Terah in the land of his birth, Ur of the Chaldees."
1828,bbe,"And Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and Iscah."
1829,bbe,And Sarai had no child.
1830,bbe,"And Terah took Abram, his son, and Lot, the son of Haran, and Sarai, his daughter-in-law, the wife of his son Abram and they went out from Ur of the Chaldees, to go to the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and were there for some time."
1831,bbe,And all the years of Terah's life were two hundred and five: and Terah came to his end in Haran.
1832,bbe,"Now the Lord said to Abram, Go out from your country and from your family and from your father's house, into the land to which I will be your guide:"
1833,bbe,"And I will make of you a great nation, blessing you and making your name great; and you will be a blessing:"
1834,bbe,"To them who are good to you will I give blessing, and on him who does you wrong will I put my curse: and you will become a name of blessing to all the families of the earth."
1835,bbe,"So Abram went as the Lord had said to him, and Lot went with him: Abram was seventy-five years old when he went away from Haran."
1836,bbe,"And Abram took Sarai, his wife, and Lot, his brother's son, and all their goods and the servants which they had got in Haran, and they went out to go to the land of Canaan."
1837,bbe,"And Abram went through the land till he came to Shechem, to the holy tree of Moreh. At that time, the Canaanites were still living in the land."
1838,bbe,"And the Lord came to Abram, and said, I will give all this land to your seed; then Abram made an altar there to the Lord who had let himself be seen by him."
1839,bbe,"And moving on from there to the mountain on the east of Beth-el, he put up his tent, having Beth-el on the west and Ai on the east: and there he made an altar and gave worship to the name of the Lord."
1840,bbe,"And he went on, journeying still to the South."
1841,bbe,"And because there was little food to be had in that land, he went down into Egypt."
1842,bbe,"Now when he came near to Egypt, he said to Sarai, his wife, Truly, you are a fair woman and beautiful to the eye;"
1843,bbe,"And I am certain that when the men of Egypt see you, they will say, This is his wife: and they will put me to death and keep you."
1844,bbe,"Say, then, that you are my sister, and so it will be well with me because of you, and my life will be kept safe on your account."
1845,bbe,"And so it was that when Abram came into Egypt, the men of Egypt, looking on the woman, saw that she was fair."
1846,bbe,"And Pharaoh's great men, having seen her, said words in praise of her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into Pharaoh's house."
1847,bbe,"And because of her, he was good to Abram, and he had sheep and oxen and asses, and men-servants and women-servants, and camels."
1848,bbe,"And the Lord sent great troubles on Pharaoh's house because of Sarai, Abram's wife."
1849,bbe,"Then Pharaoh sent for Abram, and said, What have you done to me? why did you not say that she was your wife?"
1850,bbe,"Why did you say that she was your sister? so that I took her for my wife: now, take your wife and go on your way."
1851,bbe,"And Pharaoh gave orders to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and all he had."
1852,bbe,"And Abram went up out of Egypt with his wife and all he had, and Lot with him, and they came in to the South."
1853,bbe,Now Abram had great wealth of cattle and silver and gold.
1854,bbe,"And travelling on from the South, he came to Beth-el, to the place where his tent had been before, between Beth-el and Ai;"
1855,bbe,"To the place where he had made his first altar, and there Abram gave worship to the name of the Lord."
1856,bbe,"And Lot, who went with him, had flocks and herds and tents;"
1857,bbe,So that the land was not wide enough for the two of them: their property was so great that there was not room for them together.
1858,bbe,And there was an argument between the keepers of Abram's cattle and the keepers of Lot's cattle: at that time the Canaanites and Perizzites were still living in the land.
1859,bbe,"Then Abram said to Lot, Let there be no argument between me and you, and between my herdmen and your herdmen, for we are brothers."
1860,bbe,"Is not all the land before you? then let us go our separate ways: if you go to the left, I will go to the right; or if you take the right, I will go to the left."
1861,bbe,"And Lot, lifting up his eyes and looking an the valley of Jordan, saw that it was well watered everywhere, before the Lord had sent destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah; it was like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, on the way to Zoar."
1862,bbe,"So Lot took for himself all the valley of Jordan, and went to the east, and they were parted from one another."
1863,bbe,"Abram went on living in the land of Canaan, and Lot went to the lowland towns, moving his tent as far as Sodom."
1864,bbe,"Now the men of Sodom were evil, and great sinners before the Lord."
1865,bbe,"And the Lord had said to Abram, after Lot was parted from him, From this place where you are take a look to the north and to the south, to the east and to the west:"
1866,bbe,For all the land which you see I will give to you and to your seed for ever.
1867,bbe,"And I will make your children like the dust of the earth, so that if the dust of the earth may be numbered, then will your children be numbered."
1868,bbe,"Come, go through all the land from one end to the other for I will give it to you."
1869,bbe,"And Abram, moving his tent, came and made his living-place by the holy tree of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and made an altar there to the Lord."
1870,bbe,"Now in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch, king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goiim,"
1871,bbe,"They made war with Bera, king of Sodom, and with Birsha, king of Gomorrah, Shinab, king of Admah, and Shemeber, king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (which is Zoar)."
1872,bbe,All these came together in the valley of Siddim (which is the Salt Sea).
1873,bbe,"For twelve years they were under the rule of Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they put off his control."
1874,bbe,"And in the fourteenth year, Chedorlaomer and the kings who were on his side, overcame the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,"
1875,bbe,"And the Horites in their mountain Seir, driving them as far as El-paran, which is near the waste land."
1876,bbe,"Then they came back to En-mishpat (which is Kadesh), making waste all the country of the Amalekites and of the Amorites living in Hazazon-tamar."
1877,bbe,"And the king of Sodom with the king of Gomorrah and the king of Admah and the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela (that is Zoar), went out, and put their forces in position in the valley of Siddim,"
1878,bbe,"Against Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goiim, and Amraphel, king of Shinar, and Arioch, king of Ellasar: four kings against the five."
1879,bbe,"Now the valley of Siddim was full of holes of sticky earth; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah were put to flight and came to their end there, but the rest got away to the mountain."
1880,bbe,And the four kings took all the goods and food from Sodom and Gomorrah and went on their way.
1881,bbe,"And in addition they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who was living in Sodom, and all his goods."
1882,bbe,"And one who had got away from the fight came and gave word of it to Abram the Hebrew, who was living by the holy tree of Mamre, the Amorite, the brother of Eshcol and Aner, who were friends of Abram."
1883,bbe,"And Abram, hearing that his brother's son had been made a prisoner, took a band of his trained men, three hundred and eighteen of them, sons of his house, and went after them as far as Dan."
1884,bbe,"And separating his forces by night, he overcame them, putting them to flight and going after them as far as Hobah, which is on the north side of Damascus."
1885,bbe,"And he got back all the goods, and Lot, his brother's son, with his goods and the women and the people."
1886,bbe,"And when he was coming back after putting to flight Chedorlaomer and the other kings, he had a meeting with the king of Sodom in the valley of Shaveh, that is, the King's Valley."
1887,bbe,"And Melchizedek, king of Salem, the priest of the Most High God, took bread and wine,"
1888,bbe,"And blessing him, said, May the blessing of the Most High God, maker of heaven and earth, be on Abram:"
1889,bbe,"And let the Most High God be praised, who has given into your hands those who were against you. Then Abram gave him a tenth of all the goods he had taken."
1890,bbe,"And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the prisoners and take the goods for yourself."
1891,bbe,"But Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have taken an oath to the Lord, the Most High God, maker of heaven and earth,"
1892,bbe,"That I will not take so much as a thread or the cord of a shoe of yours; so that you may not say, I have given wealth to Abram:"
1893,bbe,Give me nothing but the food which the fighting-men who went with me have had; but let Aner and Eshcol and Mamre have their part of the goods.
1894,bbe,"After these things, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, saying, Have no fear, Abram: I will keep you safe, and great will be your reward."
1895,bbe,"And Abram said, What will you give me? for I have no child and this Eliezer of Damascus will have all my wealth after me."
1896,bbe,"And Abram said, You have given me no child, and a servant in my house will get the heritage."
1897,bbe,"Then said the Lord, This man will not get the heritage, but a son of your body will have your property after you."
1898,bbe,"And he took him out into the open air, and said to him, Let your eyes be lifted to heaven, and see if the stars may be numbered; even so will your seed be."
1899,bbe,"And he had faith in the Lord, and it was put to his account as righteousness."
1900,bbe,"And he said to him, I am the Lord, who took you from Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land for your heritage."
1901,bbe,"And he said, O Lord God, how may I be certain that it will be mine?"
1902,bbe,"And he said, Take a young cow of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a sheep of three years old, and a dove and a young pigeon."
1903,bbe,"All these he took, cutting them in two and putting one half opposite the other, but not cutting the birds in two."
1904,bbe,"And evil birds came down on the bodies, but Abram sent them away."
1905,bbe,"Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep came on Abram, and a dark cloud of fear."
1906,bbe,"And he said to Abram, Truly, your seed will be living in a land which is not theirs, as servants to a people who will be cruel to them for four hundred years;"
1907,bbe,"But I will be the judge of that nation whose servants they are, and they will come out from among them with great wealth."
1908,bbe,"As for you, you will go to your fathers in peace; at the end of a long life you will be put in your last resting-place."
1909,bbe,And in the fourth generation they will come back here; for at present the sin of the Amorite is not full.
1910,bbe,"Then when the sun went down and it was dark, he saw a smoking fire and a flaming light which went between the parts of the bodies."
1911,bbe,"In that day the Lord made an agreement with Abram, and said, To your seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:"
1912,bbe,"The Kenite, the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,"
1913,bbe,"And the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,"
1914,bbe,"And the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite."
1915,bbe,"Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had given him no children; and she had a servant, a woman of Egypt whose name was Hagar."
1916,bbe,"And Sarai said to Abram, See, the Lord has not let me have children; go in to my servant, for I may get a family through her. And Abram did as Sarai said."
1917,bbe,"So after Abram had been living for ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai took Hagar, her Egyptian servant, and gave her to Abram for his wife."
1918,bbe,"And he went in to Hagar and she became with child, and when she saw that she was with child, she no longer had any respect for her master's wife."
1919,bbe,"And Sarai said to Abram, May my wrong be on you: I gave you my servant for your wife and when she saw that she was with child, she no longer had any respect for me: may the Lord be judge between you and me."
1920,bbe,"And Abram said, The woman is in your power; do with her whatever seems good to you. And Sarai was cruel to her, so that she went running away from her."
1921,bbe,"And an angel of the Lord came to her by a fountain of water in the waste land, by the fountain on the way to Shur."
1922,bbe,"And he said, Hagar, Sarai's servant, where have you come from and where are you going? And she said, I am running away from Sarai, my master's wife."
1923,bbe,"And the angel said to her, Go back, and put yourself under her authority."
1924,bbe,"And the angel of the Lord said, Your seed will be greatly increased so that it may not be numbered."
1925,bbe,"And the angel of the Lord said, See, you are with child and will give birth to a son, to whom you will give the name Ishmael, because the ears of the Lord were open to your sorrow."
1926,bbe,"And he will be like a mountain ass among men; his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him, and he will keep his place against all his brothers."
1927,bbe,"And to the Lord who was talking with her she gave this name, You are a God who is seen; for she said, Have I not even here in the waste land had a vision of God and am still living?"
1928,bbe,"So that fountain was named, Fountain of Life and Vision: it is between Kadesh and Bered."
1929,bbe,"And Hagar gave birth to a child, the son of Abram, to whom Abram gave the name of Ishmael."
1930,bbe,Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael.
1931,bbe,"When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord came to him, and said, I am God, Ruler of all; go in my ways and be upright in all things,"
1932,bbe,"And I will make an agreement between you and me, and your offspring will be greatly increased."
1933,bbe,"And Abram went down on his face on the earth, and the Lord God went on talking with him, and said,"
1934,bbe,"As for me, my agreement is made with you, and you will be the father of nations without end."
1935,bbe,"No longer will your name be Abram, but Abraham, for I have made you the father of a number of nations."
1936,bbe,"I will make you very fertile, so that nations will come from you and kings will be your offspring."
1937,bbe,"And I will make between me and you and your seed after you through all generations, an eternal agreement to be a God to you and to your seed after you."
1938,bbe,"And to you and to your seed after you, I will give the land in which you are living, all the land of Canaan for an eternal heritage; and I will be their God."
1939,bbe,"And God said to Abraham, On your side, you are to keep the agreement, you and your seed after you through all generations."
1940,bbe,"And this is the agreement which you are to keep with me, you and your seed after you: every male among you is to undergo circumcision."
1941,bbe,"In the flesh of your private parts you are to undergo it, as a mark of the agreement between me and you."
1942,bbe,"Every male among you, from one generation to another, is to undergo circumcision when he is eight days old, with every servant whose birth takes place in your house, or for whom you gave money to someone of another country, and not of your seed."
1943,bbe,"He who comes to birth in your house and he who is made yours for a price, all are to undergo circumcision; so that my agreement may be marked in your flesh, an agreement for all time."
1944,bbe,And any male who does not undergo circumcision will be cut off from his people: my agreement has been broken by him.
1945,bbe,"And God said, As for Sarai, your wife, from now her name will be not Sarai, but Sarah."
1946,bbe,"And I will give her a blessing so that you will have a son by her: truly my blessing will be on her, and she will be the mother of nations: kings of peoples will be her offspring."
1947,bbe,"Then Abraham went down on his face, and laughing, said in his heart, May a man a hundred years old have a child? will Sarah, at ninety years old, give birth?"
1948,bbe,"And Abraham said to God, If only Ishmael's life might be your care!"
1949,bbe,"And God said, Not so; but Sarah, your wife, will have a son, and you will give him the name Isaac, and I will make my agreement with him for ever and with his seed after him."
1950,bbe,"As for Ishmael, I have given ear to your prayer: truly I have given him my blessing and I will make him fertile and give him great increase; he will be the father of twelve chiefs, and I will make him a great nation."
1951,bbe,"But my agreement will be with Isaac, to whom Sarah will give birth a year from this time."
1952,bbe,"And having said these words, God went up from Abraham."
1953,bbe,"And Abraham took Ishmael, his son, and all whose birth had taken place in his house, and all his servants whom he had made his for a price, every male of his house, and on that very day he gave them circumcision in the flesh of their private parts as God had said to him."
1954,bbe,Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he underwent circumcision.
1955,bbe,"And Ishmael, his son, was thirteen years old when he underwent circumcision."
1956,bbe,"Abraham and Ishmael, his son, underwent circumcision on that very day."
1957,bbe,"And all the men of his house, those whose birth had taken place in the house and those whom he had got for money from men of other lands, underwent circumcision with him."
1958,bbe,"Now the Lord came to him by the holy tree of Mamre, when he was seated in the doorway of his tent in the middle of the day;"
1959,bbe,"And lifting up his eyes, he saw three men before him; and seeing them, he went quickly to them from the door of the tent, and went down on his face to the earth;"
1960,bbe,"And said, My Lord, if now I have grace in your eyes, do not go away from your servant:"
1961,bbe,"Let me get water for washing your feet, and take your rest under the tree:"
1962,bbe,"And let me get a bit of bread to keep up your strength, and after that you may go on your way: for this is why you have come to your servant. And they said, Let it be so."
1963,bbe,"Then Abraham went quickly into the tent, and said to Sarah, Get three measures of meal straight away and make cakes."
1964,bbe,"And running to the herd, he took a young ox, soft and fat, and gave it to the servant and he quickly made it ready;"
1965,bbe,"And he took butter and milk and the young ox which he had made ready and put it before them, waiting by them under the tree while they took food."
1966,bbe,"And they said to him, Where is Sarah your wife? And he said, She is in the tent."
1967,bbe,"And he said, I will certainly come back to you in the spring, and Sarah your wife will have a son. And his words came to the ears of Sarah who was at the back of the tent-door."
1968,bbe,"Now Abraham and Sarah were very old, and Sarah was past the time for giving birth."
1969,bbe,"And Sarah, laughing to herself, said, Now that I am used up am I still to have pleasure, my husband himself being old?"
1970,bbe,"And the Lord said, Why was Sarah laughing and saying, Is it possible for me, being old, to give birth to a child?"
1971,bbe,"Is there any wonder which the Lord is not able to do? At the time I said, in the spring, I will come back to you, and Sarah will have a child."
1972,bbe,"Then Sarah said, I was not laughing; for she was full of fear. And he said, No, but you were laughing."
1973,bbe,And the men went on from there in the direction of Sodom; and Abraham went with them on their way.
1974,bbe,"And the Lord said, Am I to keep back from Abraham the knowledge of what I do;"
1975,bbe,"Seeing that Abraham will certainly become a great and strong nation, and his name will be used by all the nations of the earth as a blessing?"
1976,bbe,"For I have made him mine so that he may give orders to his children and those of his line after him, to keep the ways of the Lord, to do what is good and right: so that the Lord may do to Abraham as he has said."
1977,bbe,"And the Lord said, Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is very great, and their sin is very evil,"
1978,bbe,"I will go down now, and see if their acts are as bad as they seem from the outcry which has come to me; and if they are not, I will see."
1979,bbe,"And the men, turning from that place, went on to Sodom: but Abraham was still waiting before the Lord."
1980,bbe,"And Abraham came near, and said, Will you let destruction come on the upright with the sinners?"
1981,bbe,"If by chance there are fifty upright men in the town, will you give the place to destruction and not have mercy on it because of the fifty upright men?"
1982,bbe,"Let such a thing be far from you, to put the upright to death with the sinner: will not the judge of all the earth do right?"
1983,bbe,"And the Lord said, If there are fifty upright men in the town, I will have mercy on it because of them."
1984,bbe,"And Abraham answering said, Truly, I who am only dust, have undertaken to put my thoughts before the Lord:"
1985,bbe,"If by chance there are five less than fifty upright men, will you give up all the town to destruction because of these five? And he said, I will not give it to destruction if there are forty-five."
1986,bbe,"And again he said to him, By chance there may be forty there. And he said, I will not do it if there are forty."
1987,bbe,"And he said, Let not the Lord be angry with me if I say, What if there are thirty there? And he said, I will not do it if there are thirty."
1988,bbe,"And he said, See now, I have undertaken to put my thoughts before the Lord: what if there are twenty there? And he said, I will have mercy because of the twenty."
1989,bbe,"And he said, O let not the Lord be angry and I will say only one word more: by chance there may be ten there. And he said, I will have mercy because of the ten."
1990,bbe,"And the Lord went on his way when his talk with Abraham was ended, and Abraham went back to his place."
1991,bbe,"And at nightfall the two angels came to Sodom; and Lot was seated at the way into the town: and when he saw them he got up and came before them, falling down on his face to the earth."
1992,bbe,"And he said, My masters, come now into your servant's house and take your rest there for the night, and let your feet be washed; and early in the morning you may go on your way. And they said, Not so, but we will take our night's rest in the street."
1993,bbe,"But he made his request more strongly, so they went with him into his house; and he got food ready for them, and made unleavened bread, of which they took."
1994,bbe,"But before they had gone to bed, the men of the town, all the men of Sodom, came round the house, young and old, from every part of the town;"
1995,bbe,"And crying out to Lot, they said, Where are the men who came to your house this night? Send them out to us, so that we may take our pleasure with them."
1996,bbe,"And Lot went out to them in the doorway, shutting the door after him."
1997,bbe,"And he said, My brothers, do not this evil."
1998,bbe,"See now, I have two unmarried daughters; I will send them out to you so that you may do to them whatever seems good to you: only do nothing to these men, for this is why they have come under the shade of my roof."
1999,bbe,"And they said, Give way there. This one man, they said, came here from a strange country, and will he now be our judge? now we will do worse to you than to them; and pushing violently against Lot, they came near to get the door broken in."
2000,bbe,"But the men put out their hands and took Lot into the house to them, shutting the door again."
2001,bbe,"But the men who were outside the door they made blind, all of them, small and great, so that they were tired out with looking for the door."
2002,bbe,"Then the men said to Lot, Are there any others of your family here? sons-in-law or sons or daughters, take them all out of this place;"
2003,bbe,"For we are about to send destruction on this place, because a great outcry against them has come to the ears of the Lord; and the Lord has sent us to put an end to the town."
2004,bbe,"And Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were married to his daughters, Come, let us go out of this place, for the Lord is about to send destruction on the town. But his sons-in-law did not take him seriously."
2005,bbe,"And when morning came, the angels did all in their power to make Lot go, saying, Get up quickly and take your wife and your two daughters who are here, and go, for fear that you come to destruction in the punishment of the town."
2006,bbe,"But while he was waiting, the men took him and his wife and his daughters by the hand, for the Lord had mercy on them, and put them outside the town."
2007,bbe,"And when they had put them out, he said, Go for your life, without looking back or waiting in the lowland; go quickly to the mountain or you will come to destruction."
2008,bbe,"And Lot said to them, Not so, O my Lord;"
2009,bbe,"See now, your servant has had grace in your eyes and great is your mercy in keeping my life from destruction, but I am not able to get as far as the mountain before evil overtakes me and death;"
2010,bbe,"This town, now, is near, and it is a little one: O, let me go there (is it not a little one?) so that my life may be safe."
2011,bbe,"And he said, See, I have given you your request in this one thing more: I will not send destruction on this town."
2012,bbe,"Go there quickly, for I am not able to do anything till you have come there. For this reason, the town was named Zoar."
2013,bbe,The sun was up when Lot came to Zoar.
2014,bbe,Then the Lord sent fire and flaming smoke raining down from heaven on Sodom and Gomorrah.
2015,bbe,"And he sent destruction on those towns, with all the lowland and all the people of those towns and every green thing in the land."
2016,bbe,"But Lot's wife, looking back, became a pillar of salt."
2017,bbe,And Abraham got up early in the morning and went to the place where he had been talking with the Lord:
2018,bbe,"And looking in the direction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the lowland, he saw the smoke of the land going up like the smoke of an oven."
2019,bbe,"So it came about that when God sent destruction on the towns of the lowland, he kept his word to Abraham, and sent Lot safely away when he put an end to the towns where he was living."
2020,bbe,"Then Lot went up out of Zoar to the mountain, and was living there with his two daughters, for fear kept him from living in Zoar: and he and his daughters made their living-place in a hole in the rock."
2021,bbe,"And the older daughter said to her sister, Our father is old, and there is no man to be a husband to us in the natural way:"
2022,bbe,"Come, let us give our father much wine, and we will go into his bed, so that we may have offspring by our father,"
2023,bbe,And that night they made their father take much wine; and the older daughter went into his bed; and he had no knowledge of when she went in or when she went away.
2024,bbe,"And on the day after, the older daughter said to the younger, Last night I was with my father; let us make him take much wine this night again, and do you go to him, so that we may have offspring by our father."
2025,bbe,And that night again they made their father take much wine; and the younger daughter went into his bed; and he had no knowledge of when she went in or when she went away.
2026,bbe,And so the two daughters of Lot were with child by their father.
2027,bbe,"And the older daughter had a son, and she gave him the name Moab: he is the father of the Moabites to this day."
2028,bbe,And the younger had a son and gave him the name Ben-ammi: from him come the children of Ammon to this day.
2029,bbe,"And Abraham went on his way from there to the land of the South, and was living between Kadesh and Shur, in Gerar."
2030,bbe,"And Abraham said of Sarah, his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent and took Sarah."
2031,bbe,"But God came to Abimelech in a dream in the night, and said to him, Truly you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken; for she is a man's wife."
2032,bbe,"Now Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, Lord, will you put to death an upright nation?"
2033,bbe,"Did he not say to me himself, She is my sister? and she herself said, He is my brother: with an upright heart and clean hands have I done this."
2034,bbe,"And God said to him in the dream, I see that you have done this with an upright heart, and I have kept you from sinning against me: for this reason I did not let you come near her."
2035,bbe,"So now, give the man back his wife, for he is a prophet, and let him say a prayer for you, so your life may be safe: but if you do not give her back, be certain that death will come to you and all your house."
2036,bbe,"So Abimelech got up early in the morning and sent for all his servants and gave them word of these things, and they were full of fear."
2037,bbe,"Then Abimelech sent for Abraham, and said, What have you done to us? what wrong have I done you that you have put on me and on my kingdom so great a sin? You have done to me things which are not to be done."
2038,bbe,"And Abimelech said to Abraham, Why did you do this thing?"
2039,bbe,"And Abraham said, Because it seemed to me that there was no fear of God in this place, and that they might put me to death because of my wife."
2040,bbe,"And, in fact, she is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife:"
2041,bbe,"And when God sent me wandering from my father's house, I said to her, Let this be the sign of your love for me; wherever we go, say of me, He is my brother."
2042,bbe,"Then Abimelech gave to Abraham sheep and oxen and men-servants and women-servants, and gave him back his wife Sarah."
2043,bbe,"And Abimelech said, See, all my land is before you; take whatever place seems good to you."
2044,bbe,"And he said to Sarah, See, I have given to your brother a thousand bits of silver so that your wrong may be put right; now your honour is clear in the eyes of all."
2045,bbe,"Then Abraham made prayer to God, and God made Abimelech well again, and his wife and his women-servants, so that they had children."
2046,bbe,"For the Lord had kept all the women of the house of Abimelech from having children, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife."
2047,bbe,And the Lord came to Sarah as he had said and did to her as he had undertaken.
2048,bbe,"And Sarah became with child, and gave Abraham a son when he was old, at the time named by God."
2049,bbe,"And Abraham gave to his son, to whom Sarah had given birth, the name Isaac."
2050,bbe,"And when his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham made him undergo circumcision, as God had said to him."
2051,bbe,Now Abraham was a hundred years old when the birth of Isaac took place.
2052,bbe,"And Sarah said, God has given me cause for laughing, and everyone who has news of it will be laughing with me."
2053,bbe,"And she said, Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would have a child at her breast? for see, I have given him a son now when he is old."
2054,bbe,"And when the child was old enough to be taken from the breast, Abraham made a great feast."
2055,bbe,And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian playing with Isaac.
2056,bbe,"So she said to Abraham, Send away that woman and her son: for the son of that woman is not to have a part in the heritage with my son Isaac."
2057,bbe,And this was a great grief to Abraham because of his son.
2058,bbe,"But God said, Let it not be a grief to you because of the boy and Hagar his mother; give ear to whatever Sarah says to you, because it is from Isaac that your seed will take its name."
2059,bbe,"And I will make a nation of the son of your servant-woman, because he is your seed."
2060,bbe,"And early in the morning Abraham got up, and gave Hagar some bread and a water-skin, and put the boy on her back, and sent her away: and she went, wandering in the waste land of Beer-sheba."
2061,bbe,"And when all the water in the skin was used up, she put the child down under a tree."
2062,bbe,"And she went some distance away, about an arrow flight, and seating herself on the earth, she gave way to bitter weeping, saying, Let me not see the death of my child."
2063,bbe,"And the boy's cry came to the ears of God; and the angel of God said to Hagar from heaven, Hagar, why are you weeping? have no fear, for the child's cry has come to the ears of God."
2064,bbe,"Come, take your child in your arms, for I will make of him a great nation."
2065,bbe,"Then God made her eyes open, and she saw a water-spring, and she got water in the skin and gave the boy a drink."
2066,bbe,"And God was with the boy, and he became tall and strong, and he became a bowman, living in the waste land."
2067,bbe,"And while he was in the waste land of Paran, his mother got him a wife from the land of Egypt."
2068,bbe,"Now at that time, Abimelech and Phicol, the captain of his army, said to Abraham, I see that God is with you in all you do."
2069,bbe,"Now, then, give me your oath, in the name of God, that you will not be false to me or to my sons after me, but that as I have been good to you, so you will be to me and to this land where you have been living."
2070,bbe,"And Abraham said, I will give you my oath."
2071,bbe,But Abraham made a protest to Abimelech because of a water-hole which Abimelech's servants had taken by force.
2072,bbe,"But Abimelech said, I have no idea who has done this thing; you never gave me word of it, and I had no knowledge of it till this day."
2073,bbe,"And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made an agreement together."
2074,bbe,And Abraham put seven young lambs of the flock on one side by themselves.
2075,bbe,"Then Abimelech said, What are these seven lambs which you have put on one side?"
2076,bbe,"And he said, Take these seven lambs from me as a witness that I have made this water-hole."
2077,bbe,"So he gave that place the name Beer-sheba, because there the two of them had given their oaths."
2078,bbe,"So they made an agreement at Beer-sheba, and Abimelech and Phicol, the captain of his army, went back to the land of the Philistines."
2079,bbe,"And Abraham, after planting a holy tree in Beer-sheba, gave worship to the name of the Lord, the Eternal God."
2080,bbe,And Abraham went on living in the land of the Philistines as in a strange country.
2081,bbe,"Now after these things, God put Abraham to the test, and said to him, Abraham; and he said, Here am I."
2082,bbe,"And he said to him, Take your son, your dearly loved only son Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah and give him as a burned offering on one of the mountains of which I will give you knowledge."
2083,bbe,"And Abraham got up early in the morning, and made ready his ass, and took with him two of his young men and Isaac, his son, and after the wood for the burned offering had been cut, he went on his way to the place of which God had given him word."
2084,bbe,"And on the third day, Abraham, lifting up his eyes, saw the place a long way off."
2085,bbe,"Then he said to his young men, Keep here with the ass; and I and the boy will go on and give worship and come back again to you."
2086,bbe,"And Abraham put the wood for the burned offering on his son's back, and he himself took the fire and the knife in his hand, and the two of them went on together."
2087,bbe,"Then Isaac said to Abraham, My father; and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, We have wood and fire here, but where is the lamb for the burned offering?"
2088,bbe,"And Abraham said, God himself will give the lamb for the burned offering: so they went on together."
2089,bbe,"And they came to the place of which God had given him knowledge; and there Abraham made the altar and put the wood in place on it, and having made tight the bands round Isaac his son, he put him on the wood on the altar."
2090,bbe,"And stretching out his hand, Abraham took the knife to put his son to death."
2091,bbe,"But the voice of the angel of the Lord came from heaven, saying, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I."
2092,bbe,"And he said, Let not your hand be stretched out against the boy to do anything to him; for now I am certain that the fear of God is in your heart, because you have not kept back your son, your only son, from me."
2093,bbe,"And lifting up his eyes, Abraham saw a sheep fixed by its horns in the brushwood: and Abraham took the sheep and made a burned offering of it in place of his son."
2094,bbe,"And Abraham gave that place the name Yahweh-yireh: as it is said to this day, In the mountain the Lord is seen."
2095,bbe,"And the voice of the angel of the Lord came to Abraham a second time from heaven,"
2096,bbe,"Saying, I have taken an oath by my name, says the Lord, because you have done this and have not kept back from me your dearly loved only son,"
2097,bbe,"That I will certainly give you my blessing, and your seed will be increased like the stars of heaven and the sand by the seaside; your seed will take the land of those who are against them;"
2098,bbe,"And your seed will be a blessing to all the nations of the earth, because you have done what I gave you orders to do."
2099,bbe,"Then Abraham went back to his young men and they went together to Beer-sheba, the place where Abraham was living."
2100,bbe,"After these things, Abraham had news that Milcah, the wife of his brother Nahor, had given birth to children;"
2101,bbe,"Uz the oldest, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel, the father of Aram,"
2102,bbe,And Chesed and Hazo and Pildash and Jidlaph and Bethuel.
2103,bbe,"Bethuel was the father of Rebekah: these eight were the children of Milcah and Nahor, Abraham's brother."
2104,bbe,And his servant Reumah gave birth to Tebah and Gaham and Tahash and Maacah.
2105,bbe,Now the years of Sarah's life were a hundred and twenty-seven.
2106,bbe,"And Sarah's death took place in Kiriath-arba, that is, Hebron, in the land of Canaan: and Abraham went into his house, weeping and sorrowing for Sarah."
2107,bbe,"And Abraham came from his dead and said to the children of Heth,"
2108,bbe,"I am living among you as one from a strange country: give me some land here as my property, so that I may put my dead to rest."
2109,bbe,"And in answer the children of Heth said to Abraham,"
2110,bbe,"My lord, truly you are a great chief among us; take the best of our resting-places for your dead; not one of us will keep back from you a place where you may put your dead to rest."
2111,bbe,"And Abraham got up and gave honour to the children of Heth, the people of that land."
2112,bbe,"And he said to them, If you will let me put my dead to rest here, make a request for me to Ephron, the son of Zohar,"
2113,bbe,"That he will give me the hollow in the rock named Machpelah, which is his property at the end of his field; let him give it to me for its full price as a resting-place for my dead among you."
2114,bbe,"Now Ephron was seated among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite gave Abraham his answer in the hearing of the children of Heth, and of all those who came into his town, saying,"
2115,bbe,"No, my lord, I will give you the field with the hollow in the rock; before all the children of my people will I give it to you for a resting-place for your dead."
2116,bbe,And Abraham went down on his face before the people of the land.
2117,bbe,"And Abraham said to Ephron, in the hearing of the people of the land, If only you will give ear to me, I will give you the price of the field; take it, and let me put my dead to rest there."
2118,bbe,"So Ephron said to Abraham,"
2119,bbe,"My lord, give ear to me: the value of the land is four hundred shekels; what is that between me and you? so put your dead to rest there."
2120,bbe,"And Abraham took note of the price fixed by Ephron in the hearing of the children of Heth, and gave him four hundred shekels in current money."
2121,bbe,"So Ephron's field at Machpelah near Mamre, with the hollow in the rock and all the trees in the field and round it,"
2122,bbe,Became the property of Abraham before the eyes of the children of Heth and of all who came into the town.
2123,bbe,"Then Abraham put Sarah his wife to rest in the hollow rock in the field of Machpelah near Mamre, that is, Hebron in the land of Canaan."
2124,bbe,And the field and the hollow rock were handed over to Abraham as his property by the children of Heth.
2125,bbe,Now Abraham was old and far on in years: and the Lord had given him everything in full measure.
2126,bbe,"And Abraham said to his chief servant, the manager of all his property, Come now, put your hand under my leg:"
2127,bbe,"And take an oath by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you will not get a wife for my son Isaac from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living;"
2128,bbe,But that you will go into my country and to my relations and get a wife there for my son Isaac.
2129,bbe,"And the servant said, If by chance the woman will not come with me into this land, am I to take your son back again to the land from which you came?"
2130,bbe,"And Abraham said, Take care that you do not let my son go back to that land."
2131,bbe,"The Lord God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my birth, and made an oath to me, saying, To your seed I will give this land: he will send his angel before you and give you a wife for my son in that land."
2132,bbe,"And if the woman will not come with you, then you are free from this oath; only do not take my son back there."
2133,bbe,"And the servant put his hand under Abraham's leg, and gave him his oath about this thing."
2134,bbe,"And the servant took ten of his master's camels, and all sorts of good things of his master's, and went to Mesopotamia, to the town of Nahor."
2135,bbe,"And he made the camels take their rest outside the town by the water-spring in the evening, at the time when the women came to get water."
2136,bbe,"And he said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, let me do well in what I have undertaken this day, and give your mercy to my master Abraham."
2137,bbe,"See, I am waiting here by the water-spring; and the daughters of the town are coming out to get water:"
2138,bbe,"Now, may the girl to whom I say, Let down your vessel and give me a drink, and who says in answer, Here is a drink for you and let me give water to your camels: may she be the one marked out by you for your servant Isaac: so may I be certain that you have been good to my master Abraham."
2139,bbe,"And even before his words were ended, Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, who was the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, came out with her water-vessel on her arm."
2140,bbe,"She was a very beautiful girl, a virgin, who had never been touched by a man: and she went down to the spring to get water in her vessel."
2141,bbe,"And the servant came running to her and said, Give me a little water from your vessel."
2142,bbe,"And she said, Take a drink, my lord: and quickly letting down her vessel onto her hand, she gave him a drink."
2143,bbe,"And having done so, she said, I will get water for your camels till they have had enough."
2144,bbe,"And after putting the water from her vessel into the animals' drinking-place, she went quickly back to the spring and got water for all the camels."
2145,bbe,"And the man, looking at her, said nothing, waiting to see if the Lord had given his journey a good outcome."
2146,bbe,"And when the camels had had enough, the man took a gold nose-ring, half a shekel in weight, and two ornaments for her arms of ten shekels weight of gold;"
2147,bbe,"And said to her, Whose daughter are you? is there room in your father's house for us?"
2148,bbe,"And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, Nahor's wife."
2149,bbe,"And she said, We have a great store of dry grass and cattle-food, and there is room for you."
2150,bbe,And with bent head the man gave worship to the Lord;
2151,bbe,"And said, Praise be to the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who has given a sign that he is good and true to my master, by guiding me straight to the house of my master's family."
2152,bbe,So the girl went running and took the news of these things to her mother's house
2153,bbe,"Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he came out quickly to the man at the water-spring."
2154,bbe,"And when he saw the nose-ring and the ornaments on his sister's hands, and when she gave him word of what the man had said to her, then he went out to the man who was waiting with the camels by the water-spring."
2155,bbe,"And he said to him, Come in, you on whom is the blessing of the Lord; why are you waiting outside? for I have made the house ready for you, and a place for the camels."
2156,bbe,"Then the man came into the house, and Laban took their cords off the camels and gave them dry grass and food, and he gave to him and the men who were with him water for washing their feet."
2157,bbe,"And meat was put before him, but he said, I will not take food till I have made my business clear to you. And they said, Do so."
2158,bbe,"And he said, I am Abraham's servant."
2159,bbe,"The Lord has given my master every blessing, and he has become great: he has given him flocks and herds and silver and gold, and men-servants and women-servants and camels and asses."
2160,bbe,"And when Sarah, my master's wife, was old, she gave birth to a son, to whom he has given all he has."
2161,bbe,"And my master made me take an oath, saying, Do not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living;"
2162,bbe,But go to my father's house and to my relations for a wife for my son.
2163,bbe,"And I said to my master, What if the woman will not come with me?"
2164,bbe,"And he said, The Lord, whom I have ever kept before me, will send his angel with you, who will make it possible for you to get a wife for my son from my relations and my father's house;"
2165,bbe,"And you will be free from your oath to me when you come to my people; and if they will not give her to you, you will be free from your oath."
2166,bbe,"And I came today to the water-spring, and I said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, if it is your purpose to give a good outcome to my journey,"
2167,bbe,"Let it come about that, while I am waiting here by the water-spring, if a girl comes to get water and I say to her, Give me a little water from your vessel, and she says,"
2168,bbe,"Take a drink, and I will get water for your camels; let her be the woman marked out by the Lord for my master's son."
2169,bbe,"And even while I was saying this to myself, Rebekah came out with her vessel on her arm; and she went down to the spring to get water; and I said to her, Give me a drink."
2170,bbe,"And straight away she took down her vessel from her arm, and said, Take a drink, and I will get water for your camels."
2171,bbe,"And questioning her, I said, Whose daughter are you? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, the son of Nahor, and Milcah his wife. Then I put the ring on her nose and the ornaments on her hands."
2172,bbe,"And with bent head I gave worship and praise to the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, by whom I had been guided in the right way, to get the daughter of my master's brother for his son."
2173,bbe,"And now, say if you will do what is good and right for my master or not, in order that it may be clear to me what I have to do."
2174,bbe,"Then Laban and Bethuel said in answer, This is the Lord's doing: it is not for us to say Yes or No to you."
2175,bbe,"See, here is Rebekah: take her and go, and let her be your master's son's wife, as the Lord has said."
2176,bbe,"And at these words, Abraham's servant went down on his face and gave praise to the Lord."
2177,bbe,Then he took jewels of silver and jewels of gold and fair robes and gave them to Rebekah: and he gave things of value to her mother and her brother.
2178,bbe,"Then he and the men who were with him had food and drink, and took their rest there that night; and in the morning he got up, and said, Let me now go back to my master."
2179,bbe,"But her brother and her mother said, Let the girl be with us a week or ten days, and then she may go."
2180,bbe,"And he said, Do not keep me; the Lord has given a good outcome to my journey; let me now go back to my master."
2181,bbe,"And they said, We will send for the girl, and let her make the decision."
2182,bbe,"And they sent for Rebekah and said to her, Are you ready to go with this man? And she said, I am ready."
2183,bbe,So they sent their sister Rebekah and her servant with Abraham's servant and his men.
2184,bbe,"And they gave Rebekah their blessing, saying, O sister, may you be the mother of thousands and ten thousands; and may your seed overcome all those who make war against them."
2185,bbe,"So Rebekah and her servant-women went with the man, seated on the camels; and so the servant took Rebekah and went on his way."
2186,bbe,Now Isaac had come through the waste land to Beer-lahai-roi; for he was living in the South.
2187,bbe,"And when the evening was near, he went wandering out into the fields, and lifting up his eyes he saw camels coming."
2188,bbe,"And when Rebekah, looking up, saw Isaac, she got down from her camel,"
2189,bbe,"And said to the servant, Who is that man coming to us through the field? And the servant said, It is my master: then she took her veil, covering her face with it."
2190,bbe,Then the servant gave Isaac the story of all he had done.
2191,bbe,"And Isaac took Rebekah into his tent and she became his wife; and in his love for her, Isaac was comforted after his father's death."
2192,bbe,And Abraham took another wife named Keturah.
2193,bbe,She became the mother of Zimran and Jokshan and Medan and Midian and Ishbak and Shuah.
2194,bbe,And Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan. And from Dedan came the Asshurim and Letushim and Leummim.
2195,bbe,And from Midian came Ephah and Epher and Hanoch and Abida and Eldaah. All these were the offspring of Keturah.
2196,bbe,Now Abraham gave all his property to Isaac;
2197,bbe,"But to the sons of his other women he gave offerings, and sent them away, while he was still living, into the east country."
2198,bbe,Now the years of Abraham's life were a hundred and seventy-five.
2199,bbe,"And Abraham came to his death, an old man, full of years; and he was put to rest with his people."
2200,bbe,"And Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, put him to rest in the hollow rock of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, near Mamre;"
2201,bbe,"The same field which Abraham got from the children of Heth: there Abraham was put to rest with Sarah, his wife."
2202,bbe,"Now after the death of Abraham, the blessing of God was with Isaac, his son."
2203,bbe,"Now these are the generations of Ishmael, the son of Abraham, whose mother was Hagar the Egyptian, the servant of Sarah:"
2204,bbe,These are the names of the sons of Ishmael by their generations: Ishmael's first son was Nebaioth; then Kedar and Adbeel and Mibsam
2205,bbe,"And Mishma and Dumah and Massa,"
2206,bbe,"Hadad and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:"
2207,bbe,"These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names in their towns and their tent-circles; twelve chiefs with their peoples."
2208,bbe,"And the years of Ishmael's life were a hundred and thirty-seven: and he came to his end, and was put to rest with his people."
2209,bbe,And their country was from Havilah to Shur which is east of Egypt: they took their place to the east of all their brothers.
2210,bbe,Now these are the generations of Abraham's son Isaac:
2211,bbe,"Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramaean of Paddan-aram, and the sister of Laban the Aramaean, to be his wife."
2212,bbe,"Isaac made prayer to the Lord for his wife because she had no children; and the Lord gave ear to his prayer, and Rebekah became with child."
2213,bbe,"And the children were fighting together inside her, and she said, If it is to be so, why am I like this? So she went to put her question to the Lord."
2214,bbe,"And the Lord said to her, Two nations are in your body, and two peoples will come to birth from you: the one will be stronger than the other, and the older will be the servant of the younger."
2215,bbe,"And when the time came for her to give birth, there were two children in her body."
2216,bbe,"And the first came out red from head to foot like a robe of hair, and they gave him the name of Esau."
2217,bbe,"And after him, his brother came out, gripping Esau's foot; and he was named Jacob: Isaac was sixty years old when she gave birth to them."
2218,bbe,"And the boys came to full growth; and Esau became a man of the open country, an expert bowman; but Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents."
2219,bbe,"Now Isaac's love was for Esau, because Esau's meat was greatly to his taste: but Rebekah had more love for Jacob."
2220,bbe,And one day Jacob was cooking some soup when Esau came in from the fields in great need of food;
2221,bbe,"And Esau said to Jacob, Give me a full meal of that red soup, for I am overcome with need for food: for this reason he was named Edom."
2222,bbe,"And Jacob said, First of all give me your birthright."
2223,bbe,"And Esau said, Truly, I am at the point of death: what profit is the birthright to me?"
2224,bbe,"And Jacob said, First of all give me your oath; and he gave him his oath, handing over his birthright to Jacob."
2225,bbe,"Then Jacob gave him bread and soup; and he took food and drink and went away, caring little for his birthright."
2226,bbe,"Then came a time of great need in the land, like that which had been before in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philistines, at Gerar."
2227,bbe,"And the Lord came to him in a vision and said, Do not go down to Egypt; keep in the land of which I will give you knowledge:"
2228,bbe,"Keep in this land, and I will be with you and give you my blessing; for to you and to your seed will I give all these lands, giving effect to the oath which I made to your father Abraham;"
2229,bbe,"I will make your seed like the stars of heaven in number, and will give them all these lands, and your seed will be a blessing to all the nations of the earth;"
2230,bbe,"Because Abraham gave ear to my voice and kept my words, my rules, my orders, and my laws."
2231,bbe,So Isaac went on living in Gerar;
2232,bbe,"And when he was questioned by the men of the place about his wife, he said, She is my sister; fearing to say, She is my wife; for, he said, the men of the place may put me to death on account of Rebekah; because she is very beautiful."
2233,bbe,"And when he had been there for some time, Abimelech, king of the Philistines, looking through a window, saw Isaac playing with Rebekah his wife."
2234,bbe,"And he said to Isaac, It is clear that she is your wife: why then did you say, She is my sister? And Isaac said, For fear that I might be put to death because of her."
2235,bbe,"Then Abimelech said, What have you done to us? one of the people might well have had connection with your wife, and the sin would have been ours."
2236,bbe,And Abimelech gave orders to his people that anyone touching Isaac or his wife was to be put to death.
2237,bbe,"Now Isaac, planting seed in that land, got in the same year fruit a hundred times as much, for the blessing of the Lord was on him."
2238,bbe,"And his wealth became very great, increasing more and more;"
2239,bbe,For he had great wealth of flocks and herds and great numbers of servants; so that the Philistines were full of envy.
2240,bbe,"Now all the water-holes, which his father's servants had made in the days of Abraham, had been stopped up with earth by the Philistines."
2241,bbe,"And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go away from us, for you are stronger than we are."
2242,bbe,"So Isaac went away from there, and put up his tents in the valley of Gerar, making his living-place there."
2243,bbe,"And he made again the water-holes which had been made in the days of Abraham his father, and which had been stopped up by the Philistines; and he gave them the names which his father had given them."
2244,bbe,"Now Isaac's servants made holes in the valley, and came to a spring of flowing water."
2245,bbe,"But the herdmen of Gerar had a fight with Isaac's herdmen, for they said, The spring is ours: so he gave the spring the name of Esek, because there was a fight about it."
2246,bbe,"Then they made another water-hole, and there was a fight about that, so he gave it the name of Sitnah."
2247,bbe,"Then he went away from there, and made another water-hole, about which there was no fighting: so he gave it the name of Rehoboth, for he said, Now the Lord has made room for us, and we will have fruit in this land."
2248,bbe,And from there he went on to Beer-sheba.
2249,bbe,"That night the Lord came to him in a vision, and said, I am the God of your father Abraham: have no fear for I am with you, blessing you, and your seed will be increased because of my servant Abraham."
2250,bbe,"Then he made an altar there, and gave worship to the name of the Lord, and he put up his tents there, and there his servants made a water-hole."
2251,bbe,"And Abimelech had come to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his friend and Phicol, the captain of his army."
2252,bbe,"And Isaac said to them, Why have you come to me, seeing that in your hate for me you sent me away from you?"
2253,bbe,"And they said, We saw clearly that the Lord was with you: so we said, Let there be an oath between us and you, and let us make an agreement with you;"
2254,bbe,"That you will do us no damage, even as we put no hand on you, and did you nothing but good, and sent you away in peace: and now the blessing of the Lord is on you."
2255,bbe,"Then he made a feast for them, and they all had food and drink."
2256,bbe,And early in the morning they took an oath one to the other: then Isaac sent them away and they went on their way in peace.
2257,bbe,"And that day Isaac's servants came to him and gave him word of the water-hole which they had made, and said to him, We have come to water."
2258,bbe,And he gave it the name of Shibah: so the name of that town is Beer-sheba to this day.
2259,bbe,"And when Esau was forty years old, he took as his wives Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite:"
2260,bbe,And Isaac and Rebekah had grief of mind because of them.
2261,bbe,"Now when Isaac was old and his eyes had become clouded so that he was not able to see, he sent for Esau, his first son, and said to him, My son: and he said, Here am I."
2262,bbe,"And he said, See now, I am old, and my death may take place at any time:"
2263,bbe,So take your arrows and your bow and go out to the field and get meat for me;
2264,bbe,"And make me food, good to the taste, such as is pleasing to me, and put it before me, so that I may have a meal and give you my blessing before death comes to me."
2265,bbe,Now Isaac's words to his son were said in Rebekah's hearing. Then Esau went out to get the meat.
2266,bbe,"And Rebekah said to Jacob, her son, Your father said to your brother Esau in my hearing,"
2267,bbe,"Go and get some roe's meat and make me a good meal, so that I may be full, and give you my blessing before the Lord before my death."
2268,bbe,"Now, my son, do what I say."
2269,bbe,Go to the flock and get me two fat young goats; and I will make of them a meal to your father's taste:
2270,bbe,"And you will take it to him, so that he may have a good meal and give you his blessing before his death."
2271,bbe,"And Jacob said to Rebekah, his mother, But Esau my brother is covered with hair, while I am smooth:"
2272,bbe,"If by chance my father puts his hand on me, it will seem to him that I am tricking him, and he will put a curse on me in place of a blessing."
2273,bbe,"And his mother said, Let the curse be on me, my son: only do as I say, and go and get them for me."
2274,bbe,So he went and got them and took them to his mother: and she made a meal to his father's taste.
2275,bbe,"And Rebekah took the fair robes of her oldest son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son:"
2276,bbe,And she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck:
2277,bbe,"And she gave into the hand of Jacob, her son, the meat and the bread which she had made ready."
2278,bbe,"And he came to his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I: who are you, my son?"
2279,bbe,"And Jacob said, I am Esau, your oldest son; I have done as you said: come now, be seated and take of my meat, so that you may give me a blessing."
2280,bbe,"And Isaac said, How is it that you have got it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the Lord your God made it come my way."
2281,bbe,"And Isaac said, Come near so that I may put my hand on you, my son, and see if you are truly my son Esau or not."
2282,bbe,"And Jacob went near his father Isaac: and he put his hands on him; and he said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
2283,bbe,"And he did not make out who he was, because his hands were covered with hair like his brother Esau's hands: so he gave him a blessing."
2284,bbe,"And he said, Are you truly my son Esau? And he said, I am."
2285,bbe,"And he said, Put it before me and I will take of my son's meat, so that I may give you a blessing. And he put it before him and he took it; and he gave him wine, and he had a drink."
2286,bbe,"And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, my son, and give me a kiss."
2287,bbe,"And he came near and gave him a kiss; and smelling the smell of his clothing, he gave him a blessing, and said, See, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field on which the blessing of the Lord has come:"
2288,bbe,"May God give you the dew of heaven, and the good things of the earth, and grain and wine in full measure:"
2289,bbe,"Let peoples be your servants, and nations go down before you: be lord over your brothers, and let your mother's sons go down before you: a curse be on everyone by whom you are cursed, and a blessing on those who give you a blessing."
2290,bbe,"And when Isaac had come to the end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had not long gone away from Isaac his father, Esau came in from the field."
2291,bbe,"And he made ready a meal, good to the taste, and took it to his father, and said to him, Let my father get up and take of his son's meat, so that you may give me a blessing."
2292,bbe,"And Isaac his father said to him, Who are you? And he said, I am your oldest son, Esau."
2293,bbe,"And in great fear Isaac said, Who then is he who got meat and put it before me, and I took it all before you came, and gave him a blessing, and his it will be?"
2294,bbe,"And hearing the words of his father, Esau gave a great and bitter cry, and said to his father, Give a blessing to me, even to me, O my father!"
2295,bbe,"And he said, Your brother came with deceit, and took away your blessing."
2296,bbe,"And he said, Is it because he is named Jacob that he has twice taken my place? for he took away my birthright, and now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have you not kept a blessing for me?"
2297,bbe,"And Isaac answering said, But I have made him your master, and have given him all his brothers for servants; I have made him strong with grain and wine: what then am I to do for you, my son?"
2298,bbe,"And Esau said to his father, Is that the only blessing you have, my father? give a blessing to me, even me! And Esau was overcome with weeping."
2299,bbe,"Then Isaac his father made answer and said to him, Far from the fertile places of the earth, and far from the dew of heaven on high will your living-place be:"
2300,bbe,By your sword will you get your living and you will be your brother's servant; but when your power is increased his yoke will be broken from off your neck.
2301,bbe,"So Esau was full of hate for Jacob because of his father's blessing; and he said in his heart, The days of weeping for my father are near; then I will put my brother Jacob to death."
2302,bbe,"Then Rebekah, hearing what Esau had said, sent for Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, It seems that your brother Esau is purposing to put you to death."
2303,bbe,"So now, my son, do what I say: go quickly to Haran, to my brother Laban;"
2304,bbe,"And be there with him for a little time, till your brother's wrath is turned away;"
2305,bbe,Till the memory of what you have done to him is past and he is no longer angry: then I will send word for you to come back; are the two of you to be taken from me in one day?
2306,bbe,"Then Rebekah said to Isaac, My life is a weariness to me because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob takes a wife from among the daughters of Heth, such as these, the women of this land, of what use will my life be to me?"
2307,bbe,"Then Isaac sent for Jacob, and blessing him, said, Do not take a wife from among the women of Canaan;"
2308,bbe,"But go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel, your mother's father, and there get yourself a wife from the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother."
2309,bbe,"And may God, the Ruler of all, give you his blessing, giving you fruit and increase, so that you may become an army of peoples."
2310,bbe,"And may God give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your seed, so that the land of your wanderings, which God gave to Abraham, may be your heritage."
2311,bbe,"So Isaac sent Jacob away: and he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramaean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau."
2312,bbe,"So when Esau saw that Isaac had given Jacob his blessing, and sent him away to Paddan-aram to get a wife for himself there, blessing him and saying to him, Do not take a wife from among the women of Canaan;"
2313,bbe,And that Jacob had done as his father and mother said and had gone to Paddan-aram;
2314,bbe,"It was clear to Esau that his father had no love for the women of Canaan,"
2315,bbe,"So Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath, the daughter of Abraham's son Ishmael, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife in addition to the wives he had."
2316,bbe,So Jacob went out from Beer-sheba to go to Haran.
2317,bbe,"And coming to a certain place, he made it his resting-place for the night, for the sun had gone down; and he took one of the stones which were there, and putting it under his head he went to sleep in that place."
2318,bbe,"And he had a dream, and in his dream he saw steps stretching from earth to heaven, and the angels of God were going up and down on them."
2319,bbe,"And he saw the Lord by his side, saying, I am the Lord, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac: I will give to you and to your seed this land on which you are sleeping."
2320,bbe,"Your seed will be like the dust of the earth, covering all the land to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south: you and your seed will be a name of blessing to all the families of the earth."
2321,bbe,"And truly, I will be with you, and will keep you wherever you go, guiding you back again to this land; and I will not give you up till I have done what I have said to you."
2322,bbe,"And Jacob, awaking from his sleep, said, Truly, the Lord is in this place and I was not conscious of it."
2323,bbe,"And fear came on him, and he said, This is a holy place; this is nothing less than the house of God and the doorway of heaven."
2324,bbe,"And early in the morning Jacob took the stone which had been under his head, and put it up as a pillar and put oil on it."
2325,bbe,"And he gave that place the name of Beth-el, but before that time the town was named Luz."
2326,bbe,"Then Jacob took an oath, and said, If God will be with me, and keep me safe on my journey, and give me food and clothing to put on,"
2327,bbe,"So that I come again to my father's house in peace, then I will take the Lord to be my God,"
2328,bbe,"And this stone which I have put up for a pillar will be God's house: and of all you give me, I will give a tenth part to you."
2329,bbe,Then Jacob went on his journey till he came to the land of the children of the East.
2330,bbe,"And there he saw a water-hole in a field, and by the side of it three flocks of sheep, for there they got water for the sheep: and on the mouth of the water-hole there was a great stone."
2331,bbe,"And all the flocks would come together there, and when the stone had been rolled away, they would give the sheep water, and put the stone back again in its place on the mouth of the water-hole."
2332,bbe,"Then Jacob said to the herdmen, My brothers, where do you come from? And they said, From Haran."
2333,bbe,"And he said to them, Have you any knowledge of Laban, the son of Nahor? And they said, We have."
2334,bbe,"And he said to them, Is he well? And they said, He is well, and here is Rachel his daughter coming with the sheep."
2335,bbe,"Then Jacob said, The sun is still high and it is not time to get the cattle together: get water for the sheep and go and give them their food."
2336,bbe,"And they said, We are not able to do so till all the flocks have come together and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the water-hole; then we will get water for the sheep."
2337,bbe,"While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she took care of them."
2338,bbe,"Then when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, coming with Laban's sheep, he came near, and rolling the stone away from the mouth of the hole, he got water for Laban's flock."
2339,bbe,"And weeping for joy, Jacob gave Rachel a kiss."
2340,bbe,"And Rachel, hearing from Jacob that he was her father's relation and that he was the son of Rebekah, went running to give her father news of it."
2341,bbe,"And Laban, hearing news of Jacob, his sister's son, came running, and took Jacob in his arms, and kissing him, made him come into his house. And Jacob gave him news of everything."
2342,bbe,"And Laban said to him, Truly, you are my bone and my flesh. And he kept Jacob with him for the space of a month."
2343,bbe,"Then Laban said to Jacob, Because you are my brother are you to be my servant for nothing? say now, what is your payment to be?"
2344,bbe,"Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel."
2345,bbe,"And Leah's eyes were clouded, but Rachel was fair in face and form."
2346,bbe,"And Jacob was in love with Rachel; and he said, I will be your servant seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter."
2347,bbe,"And Laban said, It is better for you to have her than another man: go on living here with me."
2348,bbe,And Jacob did seven years' work for Rachel; and because of his love for her it seemed to him only a very little time.
2349,bbe,"Then Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife so that I may have her, for the days are ended."
2350,bbe,And Laban got together all the men of the place and gave a feast.
2351,bbe,"And in the evening he took Leah, his daughter, and gave her to him, and he went in to her."
2352,bbe,"And Laban gave Zilpah, his servant-girl, to Leah, to be her waiting-woman."
2353,bbe,"And in the morning Jacob saw that it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What have you done to me? was I not working for you so that I might have Rachel? why have you been false to me?"
2354,bbe,"And Laban said, In our country we do not let the younger daughter be married before the older."
2355,bbe,"Let the week of the bride-feast come to its end and then we will give you the other in addition, if you will be my servant for another seven years."
2356,bbe,"And Jacob did so; and when the week was ended, Laban gave him his daughter Rachel for his wife."
2357,bbe,And Laban gave Rachel his servant-girl Bilhah to be her waiting-woman.
2358,bbe,"Then Jacob took Rachel as his wife, and his love for her was greater than his love for Leah; and he went on working for Laban for another seven years."
2359,bbe,"Now the Lord, seeing that Leah was not loved, gave her a child; while Rachel had no children."
2360,bbe,"And Leah was with child, and gave birth to a son to whom she gave the name Reuben: for she said, The Lord has seen my sorrow; now my husband will have love for me."
2361,bbe,"Then she became with child again, and gave birth to a son; and said, Because it has come to the Lord's ears that I am not loved, he has given me this son in addition: and she gave him the name Simeon."
2362,bbe,"And she was with child again, and gave birth to a son; and said, Now at last my husband will be united to me, because I have given him three sons: so he was named Levi."
2363,bbe,"And she was with child again, and gave birth to a son: and she said, This time I will give praise to the Lord: so he was named Judah; after this she had no more children for a time."
2364,bbe,"Now Rachel, because she had no children, was full of envy of her sister; and she said to Jacob, If you do not give me children I will not go on living."
2365,bbe,"But Jacob was angry with Rachel, and said, Am I in the place of God, who has kept your body from having fruit?"
2366,bbe,"Then she said, Here is my servant Bilhah, go in to her, so that she may have a child on my knees, and I may have a family by her."
2367,bbe,"So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob went in to her."
2368,bbe,"And Bilhah became with child, and gave birth to a son."
2369,bbe,"Then Rachel said, God has been my judge, and has given ear to my voice, and has given me a son; so he was named Dan."
2370,bbe,"And again Bilhah, Rachel's servant, was with child, and gave birth to a second son."
2371,bbe,"And Rachel said, I have had a great fight with my sister, and I have overcome her: and she gave the child the name Naphtali."
2372,bbe,"When it was clear to Leah that she would have no more children for a time, she gave Zilpah, her servant, to Jacob as a wife."
2373,bbe,"And Zilpah, Leah's servant, gave birth to a son."
2374,bbe,"And Leah said, It has gone well for me: and she gave him the name Gad."
2375,bbe,"And Zilpah, Leah's servant, gave birth to a second son."
2376,bbe,"And Leah said, Happy am I! and all women will give witness to my joy: and she gave him the name Asher."
2377,bbe,"Now at the time of the grain-cutting, Reuben saw some love-fruits in the field, and took them to his mother Leah. And Rachel said to her, Let me have some of your son's love-fruits."
2378,bbe,"But Leah said to her, Is it a small thing that you have taken my husband from me? and now would you take my son's love-fruits? Then Rachel said, You may have him tonight in exchange for your son's love-fruits."
2379,bbe,"In the evening, when Jacob came in from the field, Leah went out to him and said, Tonight you are to come to me, for I have given my son's love-fruits as a price for you. And he went in to her that night."
2380,bbe,"And God gave ear to her and she became with child, and gave Jacob a fifth son."
2381,bbe,"Then Leah said, God has made payment to me for giving my servant-girl to my husband: so she gave her son the name Issachar."
2382,bbe,"And again Leah became with child, and she gave Jacob a sixth son."
2383,bbe,"And she said, God has given me a good bride-price; now at last will I have my husband living with me, for I have given him six sons: and she gave him the name Zebulun."
2384,bbe,"After that she had a daughter, to whom she gave the name Dinah."
2385,bbe,"Then God gave thought to Rachel, and hearing her prayer he made her fertile."
2386,bbe,"And she was with child, and gave birth to a son: and she said, God has taken away my shame."
2387,bbe,"And she gave him the name Joseph, saying, May the Lord give me another son."
2388,bbe,"Now after the birth of Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, Let me go away to my place and my country."
2389,bbe,"Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have been your servant, and let me go: for you have knowledge of all the work I have done for you."
2390,bbe,"And Laban said, If you will let me say so, do not go away; for I have seen by the signs that the Lord has been good to me because of you."
2391,bbe,Say then what your payment is to be and I will give it.
2392,bbe,"Then Jacob said, You have seen what I have done for you, and how your cattle have done well under my care."
2393,bbe,"For before I came you had little, and it has been greatly increased; and the Lord has given you a blessing in everything I have done; but when am I to do something for my family?"
2394,bbe,"And Laban said, What am I to give you? And Jacob said, Do not give me anything; but I will again take up the care of your flock if you will only do this for me:"
2395,bbe,"Let me go through all your flock today, taking out from among them all the sheep which are marked or coloured or black, and all the marked or coloured goats: these will be my payment."
2396,bbe,"And so you will be able to put my honour to the test in time to come; if you see among my flocks any goats which are not marked or coloured, or any sheep which is not black, you may take me for a thief."
2397,bbe,"And Laban said, Let it be as you say."
2398,bbe,"So that day he took all the he-goats which were banded or coloured, and all the she-goats which were marked or coloured or had white marks, and all the black sheep, and gave them into the care of his sons;"
2399,bbe,And sent them three days' journey away: and Jacob took care of the rest of Laban's flock.
2400,bbe,"Then Jacob took young branches of trees, cutting off the skin so that the white wood was seen in bands."
2401,bbe,And he put the banded sticks in the drinking-places where the flock came to get water; and they became with young when they came to the water.
2402,bbe,"And because of this, the flock gave birth to young which were marked with bands of colour."
2403,bbe,These lambs Jacob kept separate; and he put his flock in a place by themselves and not with Laban's flock.
2404,bbe,"And whenever the stronger ones of the flock became with young, Jacob put the sticks in front of them in the drinking-places, so that they might become with young when they saw the sticks."
2405,bbe,"But when the flocks were feeble, he did not put the sticks before them; so that the feebler flocks were Laban's and the stronger were Jacob's."
2406,bbe,So Jacob's wealth was greatly increased; he had great flocks and women-servants and men-servants and camels and asses.
2407,bbe,"Now it came to the ears of Jacob that Laban's sons were saying, Jacob has taken away all our father's property, and in this way he has got all this wealth."
2408,bbe,And Jacob saw that Laban's feeling for him was no longer what it had been before.
2409,bbe,"Then the Lord said to Jacob, Go back to the land of your fathers, and to your relations, and I will be with you."
2410,bbe,And Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to come to him in the field among his flock.
2411,bbe,"And he said to them, It is clear to me that your father's feeling is no longer what it was to me; but the God of my father has been with me"
2412,bbe,"And you have seen how I have done all in my power for your father,"
2413,bbe,"But your father has not kept faith with me, and ten times he has made changes in my payment; but God has kept him from doing me damage."
2414,bbe,"If he said, All those in the flock which have marks are to be yours, then all the flock gave birth to marked young; and if he said, All the banded ones are to be yours, then all the flock had banded young."
2415,bbe,So God has taken away your father's cattle and has given them to me.
2416,bbe,"And at the time when the flock were with young, I saw in a dream that all the he-goats which were joined with the she-goats were banded and marked and coloured."
2417,bbe,"And in my dream the angel of the Lord said to me, Jacob: and I said, Here am I."
2418,bbe,"And he said, See how all the he-goats are banded and marked and coloured: for I have seen what Laban has done to you."
2419,bbe,"I am the God of Beth-el, where you put oil on the pillar and took an oath to me: now then, come out of this land and go back to the country of your birth."
2420,bbe,"Then Rachel and Leah said to him in answer, What part or heritage is there for us in our father's house?"
2421,bbe,Are we not as people from a strange country to him? for he took a price for us and now it is all used up.
2422,bbe,"For the wealth which God has taken from him is ours and our children's; so now, whatever God has said to you, do."
2423,bbe,Then Jacob put his wives and his sons on camels;
2424,bbe,"And sending on before him all his cattle and his property which he had got together in Paddan-aram, he made ready to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan."
2425,bbe,Now Laban had gone to see to the cutting of the wool of his sheep; so Rachel secretly took the images of the gods of her father's house.
2426,bbe,"And Jacob went away secretly, without giving news of his flight to Laban the Aramaean."
2427,bbe,"So he went away with all he had, and went across the River in the direction of the hill-country of Gilead."
2428,bbe,And on the third day Laban had news of Jacob's flight.
2429,bbe,"And taking the men of his family with him, he went after him for seven days and overtook him in the hill-country of Gilead."
2430,bbe,"Then God came to Laban in a dream by night, and said to him, Take care that you say nothing good or bad to Jacob."
2431,bbe,"Now when Laban overtook him, Jacob had put up his tent in the hill-country; and Laban and his brothers put up their tents in the hill-country of Gilead."
2432,bbe,"And Laban said to Jacob, Why did you go away secretly, taking my daughters away like prisoners of war?"
2433,bbe,"Why did you make a secret of your flight, not giving me word of it, so that I might have sent you away with joy and songs, with melody and music?"
2434,bbe,You did not even let me give a kiss to my sons and my daughters. This was a foolish thing to do.
2435,bbe,"It is in my power to do you damage: but the God of your father came to me this night, saying, Take care that you say nothing good or bad to Jacob."
2436,bbe,"And now, it seems, you are going because your heart's desire is for your father's house; but why have you taken my gods?"
2437,bbe,"And Jacob, in answer, said to Laban, My fear was that you might take your daughters from me by force."
2438,bbe,"As for your gods, if anyone of us has them, let him be put to death: make search before us all for what is yours, and take it. For Jacob had no knowledge that Rachel had taken them."
2439,bbe,"So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent, and into the tents of the two servant-women, but they were not there; and he came out of Leah's tent and went into Rachel's."
2440,bbe,"Now Rachel had taken the images, and had put them in the camels' basket, and was seated on them. And Laban, searching through all the tent, did not come across them."
2441,bbe,"And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry because I do not get up before you, for I am in the common condition of women. And with all his searching, he did not come across the images."
2442,bbe,"Then Jacob was angry with Laban, and said, What crime or sin have I done that you have come after me with such passion?"
2443,bbe,"Now that you have made search through all my goods, what have you seen which is yours? Make it clear now before my people and your people, so that they may be judges between us."
2444,bbe,"These twenty years I have been with you; your sheep and your goats have had young without loss, not one of your he-goats have I taken for food."
2445,bbe,"Anything which was wounded by beasts I did not take to you, but myself made up for the loss of it; you made me responsible for whatever was taken by thieves, by day or by night."
2446,bbe,"This was my condition, wasted by heat in the day and by the bitter cold at night; and sleep went from my eyes."
2447,bbe,"These twenty years I have been in your house; I was your servant for fourteen years because of your daughters, and for six years I kept your flock, and ten times was my payment changed."
2448,bbe,"If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would have sent me away with nothing in my hands. But God has seen my troubles and the work of my hands, and this night he kept you back."
2449,bbe,"Then Laban, answering, said, These women are my daughters and these children my children, the flocks and all you see are mine: what now may I do for my daughters and for their children?"
2450,bbe,"Come, let us make an agreement, you and I; and let it be for a witness between us."
2451,bbe,Then Jacob took a stone and put it up as a pillar.
2452,bbe,"And Jacob said to his people, Get stones together; and they did so; and they had a meal there by the stones."
2453,bbe,And the name Laban gave it was Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob gave it the name of Galeed.
2454,bbe,"And Laban said, These stones are a witness between you and me today. For this reason its name was Galeed,"
2455,bbe,"And Mizpah, for he said, May the Lord keep watch on us when we are unable to see one another's doings."
2456,bbe,"If you are cruel to my daughters, or if you take other wives in addition to my daughters, then though no man is there to see, God will be the witness between us."
2457,bbe,"And Laban said, See these stones and this pillar which I have put between you and me;"
2458,bbe,"They will be witness that I will not go over these stones to you, and you will not go over these stones or this pillar to me, for any evil purpose."
2459,bbe,"May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, be our judge. Then Jacob took an oath by the Fear of his father Isaac."
2460,bbe,"And Jacob made an offering on the mountain, and gave orders to his people to take food: so they had a meal and took their rest that night on the mountain."
2461,bbe,"And early in the morning Laban, after kissing and blessing his daughters, went on his way back to his country."
2462,bbe,And on his way Jacob came face to face with the angels of God.
2463,bbe,"And when he saw them he said, This is the army of God: so he gave that place the name of Mahanaim."
2464,bbe,"Now Jacob sent servants before him to Esau, his brother, in the land of Seir, the country of Edom;"
2465,bbe,"And he gave them orders to say these words to Esau: Your servant Jacob says, Till now I have been living with Laban:"
2466,bbe,And I have oxen and asses and flocks and men-servants and women-servants: and I have sent to give my lord news of these things so that I may have grace in his eyes.
2467,bbe,"When the servants came back they said, We have seen your brother Esau and he is coming out to you, and four hundred men with him."
2468,bbe,Then Jacob was in great fear and trouble of mind: and he put all the people and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two groups;
2469,bbe,"And said, If Esau, meeting one group, makes an attack on them, the others will get away safely."
2470,bbe,"Then Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, the God of my father Isaac, the Lord who said to me, Go back to your country and your family and I will be good to you:"
2471,bbe,"I am less than nothing in comparison with all your mercies and your faith to me your servant; for with only my stick in my hand I went across Jordan, and now I have become two armies."
2472,bbe,"Be my saviour from the hand of Esau, my brother: for my fear is that he will make an attack on me, putting to death mother and child."
2473,bbe,"And you said, Truly, I will be good to you, and make your seed like the sand of the sea which may not be numbered."
2474,bbe,"Then he put up his tent there for the night; and from among his goods he took, as an offering for his brother Esau,"
2475,bbe,"Two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred females and twenty males from the sheep,"
2476,bbe,"Thirty camels with their young ones, forty cows, ten oxen, twenty asses, and ten young asses."
2477,bbe,"These he gave to his servants, every herd by itself, and he said to his servants, Go on before me, and let there be a space between one herd and another."
2478,bbe,"And he gave orders to the first, saying, When my brother Esau comes to you and says, Whose servant are you, and where are you going, and whose are these herds?"
2479,bbe,"Then say to him, These are your servant Jacob's; they are an offering for my lord, for Esau; and he himself is coming after us."
2480,bbe,"And he gave the same orders to the second and the third and to all those who were with the herds, saying, This is what you are to say to Esau when you see him;"
2481,bbe,"And you are to say further, Jacob, your servant, is coming after us. For he said to himself, I will take away his wrath by the offering which I have sent on, and then I will come before him: it may be that I will have grace in his eyes."
2482,bbe,"So the servants with the offerings went on in front, and he himself took his rest that night in the tents with his people."
2483,bbe,"And in the night he got up, and taking with him his two wives and the two servant-women and his eleven children, he went over the river Jabbok."
2484,bbe,He took them and sent them over the stream with all he had.
2485,bbe,Then Jacob was by himself; and a man was fighting with him till dawn.
2486,bbe,"But when the man saw that he was not able to overcome Jacob, he gave him a blow in the hollow part of his leg, so that his leg was damaged."
2487,bbe,"And he said to him, Let me go now, for the dawn is near. But Jacob said, I will not let you go till you have given me your blessing."
2488,bbe,"Then he said, What is your name? And he said, Jacob."
2489,bbe,"And he said, Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel: for in your fight with God and with men you have overcome."
2490,bbe,"Then Jacob said, What is your name? And he said, What is my name to you? Then he gave him a blessing."
2491,bbe,"And Jacob gave that place the name of Peniel, saying, I have seen God face to face, and still I am living."
2492,bbe,"And while he was going past Peniel, the sun came up. And he went with unequal steps because of his damaged leg."
2493,bbe,"For this reason the children of Israel, even today, never take that muscle in the hollow of the leg as food, because the hollow of Jacob's leg was touched."
2494,bbe,"Then Jacob, lifting up his eyes, saw Esau coming with his four hundred men. So he made a division of the children between Leah and Rachel and the two women-servants."
2495,bbe,"He put the servants and their children in front, Leah and her children after them, and Rachel and Joseph at the back."
2496,bbe,"And he himself, going before them, went down on his face to the earth seven times till he came near his brother."
2497,bbe,"Then Esau came running up to him, and folding him in his arms, gave him a kiss: and the two of them were overcome with weeping."
2498,bbe,"Then Esau, lifting up his eyes, saw the women and the children, and said, Who are these with you? And he said, The children whom God in his mercy has given to your servant."
2499,bbe,"Then the servants and their children came near, and went down on their faces."
2500,bbe,"And Leah came near with her children, and then Joseph and Rachel, and they did the same."
2501,bbe,"And he said, What were all those herds which I saw on the way? And Jacob said, They were an offering so that I might have grace in my lord's eyes."
2502,bbe,"But Esau said, I have enough; keep what is yours, my brother, for yourself."
2503,bbe,"And Jacob said, Not so; but if I have grace in your eyes, take them as a sign of my love, for I have seen your face as one may see the face of God, and you have been pleased with me."
2504,bbe,"Take my offering then, with my blessing; for God has been very good to me and I have enough: so at his strong request, he took it."
2505,bbe,"And he said, Let us go on our journey together, and I will go in front."
2506,bbe,"But Jacob said, My lord may see that the children are only small, and there are young ones in my flocks and herds: one day's over-driving will be the destruction of all the flock."
2507,bbe,"Do you, my lord, go on before your servant; I will come on slowly, at the rate at which the cattle and the children are able to go, till I come to my lord at Seir."
2508,bbe,"And Esau said, Then keep some of my men with you. And he said, What need is there for that, if my lord is pleased with me?"
2509,bbe,"So Esau, turning back that day, went on his way to Seir."
2510,bbe,"And Jacob went on to Succoth, where he made a house for himself and put up tents for his cattle: for this reason the place was named Succoth."
2511,bbe,"So Jacob came safely from Paddan-aram to the town of Shechem in the land of Canaan, and put up his tents near the town."
2512,bbe,"And for a hundred bits of money he got from the children of Hamor, the builder of Shechem, the field in which he had put up his tents."
2513,bbe,"And there he put up an altar, naming it El, the God of Israel."
2514,bbe,"Now Dinah, the daughter whom Leah had by Jacob, went out to see the women of that country."
2515,bbe,"And when Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite who was the chief of that land, saw her, he took her by force and had connection with her."
2516,bbe,"Then his heart went out in love to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he said comforting words to her."
2517,bbe,"And Shechem said to Hamor, his father, Get me this girl for my wife."
2518,bbe,"Now Jacob had word of what Shechem had done to his daughter; but his sons were in the fields with the cattle, and Jacob said nothing till they came."
2519,bbe,"Then Hamor, the father of Shechem, came out to have a talk with Jacob."
2520,bbe,"Now the sons of Jacob came in from the fields when they had news of it, and they were wounded and very angry because of the shame he had done in Israel by having connection with Jacob's daughter; and they said, Such a thing is not to be done."
2521,bbe,"But Hamor said to them, Shechem, my son, is full of desire for your daughter: will you then give her to him for a wife?"
2522,bbe,"And let our two peoples be joined together; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves."
2523,bbe,"Go on living with us, and the country will be open to you; do trade and get property there."
2524,bbe,"And Shechem said to her father and her brothers, If you will give ear to my request, whatever you say I will give to you."
2525,bbe,"However great you make the bride-price and payment, I will give it; only let me have the girl for my wife."
2526,bbe,"But the sons of Jacob gave a false answer to Shechem and Hamor his father, because of what had been done to Dinah their sister."
2527,bbe,"And they said, It is not possible for us to give our sister to one who is without circumcision, for that would be a cause of shame to us:"
2528,bbe,But on this condition only will we come to an agreement with you: if every male among you becomes like us and undergoes circumcision;
2529,bbe,Then we will give our daughters to you and take your daughters to us and go on living with you as one people.
2530,bbe,"But if you will not undergo circumcision as we say, then we will take our daughter and go."
2531,bbe,And their words were pleasing to Hamor and his son Shechem.
2532,bbe,"And without loss of time the young man did as they said, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter, and he was the noblest of his father's house."
2533,bbe,"Then Hamor and Shechem, his son, went to the meeting-place of their town, and said to the men of the town,"
2534,bbe,"It is the desire of these men to be at peace with us; let them then go on living in this country and doing trade here, for the country is wide open before them; let us take their daughters as wives and let us give them our daughters."
2535,bbe,"But these men will make an agreement with us to go on living with us and to become one people, only on the condition that every male among us undergoes circumcision as they have done."
2536,bbe,Then will not their cattle and their goods and all their beasts be ours? so let us come to an agreement with them so that they may go on living with us.
2537,bbe,Then all the men of the town gave ear to the words of Hamor and Shechem his son; and every male in the town underwent circumcision.
2538,bbe,"But on the third day after, before the wounds were well, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and came into the town by surprise and put all the males to death."
2539,bbe,"And Hamor and his son they put to death with the sword, and they took Dinah from Shechem's house and went away."
2540,bbe,And the sons of Jacob came on them when they were wounded and made waste the town because of what had been done to their sister;
2541,bbe,"They took their flocks and their herds and their asses and everything in their town and in their fields,"
2542,bbe,And all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives; everything in their houses they took and made them waste.
2543,bbe,"And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You have made trouble for me and given me a bad name among the people of this country, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and because we are small in number they will come together against me and make war on me; and it will be the end of me and all my people."
2544,bbe,"But they said, Were we to let him make use of our sister as a loose woman?"
2545,bbe,"And God said to Jacob, Go up now to Beth-el and make your living-place there: and put up an altar there to the God who came to you when you were in flight from your brother Esau."
2546,bbe,"Then Jacob said to all his people, Put away the strange gods which are among you, and make yourselves clean, and put on a change of clothing:"
2547,bbe,"And let us go up to Beth-el: and there I will make an altar to God, who gave me an answer in the day of my trouble, and was with me wherever I went."
2548,bbe,"Then they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which they had, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob put them away under the holy tree at Shechem."
2549,bbe,"So they went on their journey: and the fear of God was on the towns round about, so that they made no attack on the sons of Jacob."
2550,bbe,"And Jacob came to Luz in the land of Canaan (which is the same as Beth-el), he and all his people."
2551,bbe,"And there he made an altar, naming the place El-beth-el: because it was there he had the vision of God when he was in flight from his brother."
2552,bbe,"And Deborah, the servant who had taken care of Rebekah from her birth, came to her end, and was put to rest near Beth-el, under the holy tree: and they gave it the name of Allon-bacuth."
2553,bbe,"Now when Jacob was on his way from Paddan-aram, God came to him again and, blessing him, said,"
2554,bbe,"Jacob is your name, but it will be so no longer; from now your name will be Israel; so he was named Israel."
2555,bbe,"And God said to him, I am God, the Ruler of all: be fertile, and have increase; a nation, truly a group of nations, will come from you, and kings will be your offspring;"
2556,bbe,"And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to you; and to your seed after you I will give the land."
2557,bbe,Then God went up from him in the place where he had been talking with him.
2558,bbe,"And Jacob put up a pillar in the place where he had been talking with God, and put a drink offering on it, and oil."
2559,bbe,"And he gave to the place where God had been talking with him, the name of Beth-el."
2560,bbe,"So they went on from Beth-el; and while they were still some distance from Ephrath, the pains of birth came on Rachel and she had a hard time."
2561,bbe,"And when her pain was very great, the woman who was helping her said, Have no fear; for now you will have another son."
2562,bbe,"And in the hour when her life went from her (for death came to her), she gave the child the name Ben-oni: but his father gave him the name of Benjamin."
2563,bbe,So Rachel came to her end and was put to rest on the road to Ephrath (which is Beth-lehem).
2564,bbe,"And Jacob put up a pillar on her resting-place; which is named, The Pillar of the resting-place of Rachel, to this day."
2565,bbe,And Israel went journeying on and put up his tents on the other side of the tower of the flock.
2566,bbe,"Now while they were living in that country, Reuben had connection with Bilhah, his father's servant-woman: and Israel had news of it."
2567,bbe,"Now Jacob had twelve sons: the sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's first son, and Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and Zebulun;"
2568,bbe,The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;
2569,bbe,"The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's servant: Dan and Naphtali;"
2570,bbe,"The sons of Zilpah, Leah's servant: Gad and Asher; these are the sons whom Jacob had in Paddan-aram."
2571,bbe,"And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, at Kiriath-arba, that is, Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac had been living."
2572,bbe,And Isaac was a hundred and eighty years old.
2573,bbe,"Then Isaac came to his end and was put to rest with his father's people, an old man after a long life: and Jacob and Esau, his sons, put him in his last resting-place."
2574,bbe,"Now these are the generations of Esau, that is to say, Edom."
2575,bbe,"Esau's wives were women of Canaan: Adah, the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,"
2576,bbe,"And Basemath, Ishmael's daughter, the sister of Nebaioth."
2577,bbe,Adah had a son Eliphaz; and Basemath was the mother of Reuel;
2578,bbe,"Oholibamah was the mother of Jeush, Jalam, and Korah; these are the sons of Esau, whose birth took place in the land of Canaan."
2579,bbe,"Esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters, and all the people of his house, and his beasts and his cattle and all his goods which he had got together in the land of Canaan, and went into the land of Seir, away from his brother Jacob."
2580,bbe,For their wealth was so great that the land was not wide enough for the two of them and all their cattle.
2581,bbe,So Esau made his living-place in the hill-country of Seir (Esau is Edom).
2582,bbe,"And these are the generations of Esau, the father of the Edomites in the hill-country of Seir:"
2583,bbe,"These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz, the son of Esau's wife Adah, and Reuel, the son of Esau's wife Basemath."
2584,bbe,"The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz."
2585,bbe,"And Eliphaz, the son of Esau, had connection with a woman named Timna, who gave birth to Amalek: all these were the children of Esau's wife Adah."
2586,bbe,"And these are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: they were the children of Esau's wife Basemath."
2587,bbe,"And these are the sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon: she was the mother of Jeush, Jalam, and Korah."
2588,bbe,"These were the chiefs among the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz, Esau's first son: Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz,"
2589,bbe,"Korah, Gatam, Amalek: all these were chiefs in the land of Edom, the offspring of Eliphaz, the seed of Adah."
2590,bbe,"And these are the sons of Esau's son Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, Mizzah: these were the chiefs of Reuel in the land of Edom, the children of Esau's wife Basemath."
2591,bbe,"And these are the sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah: Jeush, Jalam, and Korah: these were the chiefs who came from Esau's wife Oholibamah, daughter of Anah."
2592,bbe,"These were the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these were their chiefs."
2593,bbe,"These are the sons of Seir the Horite who were living in that country; Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,"
2594,bbe,"Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan: these are the chiefs of the Horites, offspring of Seir in the land of Edom."
2595,bbe,The children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; Lotan's sister was Timna.
2596,bbe,"And these are the children of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam."
2597,bbe,"And these are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah; that same Anah who made the discovery of the water-springs in the waste land, when he was looking after the asses of his father Zibeon."
2598,bbe,And these are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah his daughter.
2599,bbe,"These are the children of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Keran."
2600,bbe,"These are the children of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan."
2601,bbe,These are the children of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
2602,bbe,"These were the Horite chiefs: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,"
2603,bbe,"Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. Such were the Horite chiefs in their order in the land of Seir."
2604,bbe,And these are the kings who were ruling in the land of Edom before there was any king over the children of Israel.
2605,bbe,"Bela, son of Beor, was king in Edom, and the name of his chief town was Dinhabah."
2606,bbe,"At his death, Jobab, son of Zerah of Bozrah, became king in his place."
2607,bbe,"And at the death of Jobab, Husham, from the country of the Temanites, became king in his place."
2608,bbe,"And at the death of Husham, Hadad, son of Bedad, who overcame the Midianites in the field of Moab, became king; his chief town was named Avith."
2609,bbe,"And at the death of Hadad, Samlah of Masrekah became king."
2610,bbe,"And at the death of Samlah, Shaul of Rehoboth by the River became king in his place."
2611,bbe,"And at the death of Shaul, Baal-hanan, son of Achbor, became king."
2612,bbe,"And at the death of Baal-hanan, Hadar became king in his place; his chief town was named Pau, and his wife's name was Mehetabel; she was the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab."
2613,bbe,"These are the names of the chiefs of Esau in the order of their families and their places: Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,"
2614,bbe,"Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,"
2615,bbe,"Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,"
2616,bbe,"Magdiel, Iram; these are the Edomite chiefs, in their places in their heritage; this is Esau, the father of the Edomites."
2617,bbe,"Now Jacob was living in the land where his father had made a place for himself, in the land of Canaan."
2618,bbe,"These are the generations of Jacob: Joseph, a boy seventeen years old, was looking after the flock, together with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives; and Joseph gave their father a bad account of them."
2619,bbe,"Now the love which Israel had for Joseph was greater than his love for all his other children, because he got him when he was an old man: and he had a long coat made for him."
2620,bbe,"And because his brothers saw that Joseph was dearer to his father than all the others, they were full of hate for him, and would not say a kind word to him."
2621,bbe,"Now Joseph had a dream, and he gave his brothers an account of it, which made their hate greater than ever."
2622,bbe,"And he said to them, Let me give you the story of my dream."
2623,bbe,"We were in the field, getting the grain stems together, and my grain kept upright, and yours came round and went down on the earth before mine."
2624,bbe,"And his brothers said to him, Are you to be our king? will you have authority over us? And because of his dream and his words, their hate for him became greater than ever."
2625,bbe,"Then he had another dream, and gave his brothers an account of it, saying, I have had another dream: the sun and the moon and eleven stars gave honour to me."
2626,bbe,"And he gave word of it to his father and his brothers; but his father protesting said, What sort of a dream is this? am I and your mother and your brothers to go down on our faces to the earth before you?"
2627,bbe,And his brothers were full of envy; but his father kept his words in mind.
2628,bbe,Now his brothers went to keep watch over their father's flock in Shechem.
2629,bbe,"And Israel said to Joseph, Are not your brothers with the flock in Shechem? come, I will send you to them. And he said to him, Here am I."
2630,bbe,"And he said to him, Go now, and see if your brothers are well and how the flock is; then come back and give me word. So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem."
2631,bbe,"And a man saw him wandering in the country, and said to him, What are you looking for?"
2632,bbe,"And he said, I am looking for my brothers; please give me word of where they are keeping their flock."
2633,bbe,"And the man said, They have gone away from here, for they said in my hearing, Let us go to Dothan. So Joseph went after them and came up with them at Dothan."
2634,bbe,"But they saw him when he was a long way off, and before he came near them they made a secret design against him to put him to death;"
2635,bbe,"Saying to one another, See, here comes this dreamer."
2636,bbe,"Let us now put him to death and put his body into one of these holes, and we will say, An evil beast has put him to death: then we will see what becomes of his dreams."
2637,bbe,"But Reuben, hearing these words, got him out of their hands, saying, Let us not take his life."
2638,bbe,"Do not put him to a violent death, but let him be placed in one of the holes; this he said to keep him safe from their hands, with the purpose of taking him back to his father again."
2639,bbe,"So when Joseph came to his brothers, they took off his long coat which he had on;"
2640,bbe,And they took him and put him in the hole: now the hole had no water in it.
2641,bbe,"Then seating themselves, they took their meal: and looking up, they saw a travelling band of Ishmaelites, coming from Gilead on their way to Egypt, with spices and perfumes on their camels."
2642,bbe,"And Judah said to his brothers, What profit is there in putting our brother to death and covering up his blood?"
2643,bbe,"Let us give him to these Ishmaelites for a price, and let us not put violent hands on him, for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brothers gave ear to him."
2644,bbe,"And some traders from Midian went by; so pulling Joseph up out of the hole, they gave him to the Ishmaelites for twenty bits of silver, and they took him to Egypt."
2645,bbe,"Now when Reuben came back to the hole, Joseph was not there; and giving signs of grief,"
2646,bbe,"He went back to his brothers, and said, The child is gone; what am I to do?"
2647,bbe,"Then they took Joseph's coat, and put on it some of the blood from a young goat which they had put to death,"
2648,bbe,"And they took the coat to their father, and said, We came across this; is it your son's coat or not?"
2649,bbe,"And he saw that it was, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast has put him to death; without doubt Joseph has come to a cruel end."
2650,bbe,"Then Jacob, giving signs of grief, put on haircloth, and went on weeping for his son day after day."
2651,bbe,"And all his sons and all his daughters came to give him comfort, but he would not be comforted, saying with weeping, I will go down to the underworld to my son. So great was his father's sorrow for him."
2652,bbe,"And in Egypt the men of Midian gave him for a price to Potiphar, a captain of high position in Pharaoh's house."
2653,bbe,"Now at that time, Judah went away from his brothers and became the friend of a man of Adullam named Hirah."
2654,bbe,"And there he saw the daughter of a certain man of Canaan named Shua, and took her as his wife."
2655,bbe,"And she gave birth to a son, and he gave him the name Er."
2656,bbe,"And again she gave birth to a son, and he gave him the name Onan."
2657,bbe,"Then she had another son, to whom she gave the name Shelah; she was at Chezib when the birth took place."
2658,bbe,"And Judah took a wife for his first son Er, and her name was Tamar."
2659,bbe,"Now Er, Judah's first son, did evil in the eyes of the Lord, so that he put him to death."
2660,bbe,"Then Judah said to Onan, Go in to your brother's wife and do what it is right for a husband's brother to do; make her your wife and get offspring for your brother."
2661,bbe,"But Onan, seeing that the offspring would not be his, went in to his brother's wife, but let his seed go on to the earth, so that he might not get offspring for his brother."
2662,bbe,"And what he did was evil in the eyes of the Lord, so that he put him to death, like his brother."
2663,bbe,"Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, Go back to your father's house and keep yourself as a widow till my son Shelah becomes a man: for he had in his mind the thought that death might come to him as it had come to his brothers. So Tamar went back to her father's house."
2664,bbe,"And after a time, Bath-shua, Judah's wife, came to her end; and after Judah was comforted for her loss, he went to Timnah, where they were cutting the wool of his sheep, and his friend Hirah of Adullam went with him."
2665,bbe,"And when Tamar had news that her father-in-law was going up to Timnah to the wool-cutting,"
2666,bbe,"She took off her widow's clothing, and covering herself with her veil, she took her seat near Enaim on the road to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was now a man, but she had not been made his wife."
2667,bbe,"When Judah saw her he took her to be a loose woman of the town, because her face was covered."
2668,bbe,"And turning to her by the roadside, he said to her, Let me come in to you; for he had no idea that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What will you give me as my price?"
2669,bbe,"And he said, I will give you a young goat from the flock. And she said, What will you give me as a sign till you send it?"
2670,bbe,"And he said, What would you have? And she said, Your ring and its cord and the stick in your hand. So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she became with child by him."
2671,bbe,Then she got up and went away and took off her veil and put on her widow's clothing.
2672,bbe,"Then Judah sent his friend Hirah with the young goat, to get back the things which he had given as a sign to the woman: but she was not there."
2673,bbe,"And he put questions to the men of the place, saying, Where is the loose woman who was in Enaim by the wayside? And they said, There was no such woman there."
2674,bbe,"So he went back to Judah, and said, I have not seen her, and the men of the place say that there is no such woman there."
2675,bbe,"And Judah said, Let her keep the things, so that we may not be shamed; I sent the young goat, but you did not see the woman."
2676,bbe,"Now about three months after this, word came to Judah that Tamar, his daughter-in-law, had been acting like a loose woman and was with child. And Judah said, Take her out and let her be burned."
2677,bbe,"And while she was being taken out, she sent word to her father-in-law, saying, The man whose property these things are, is the father of my child: say then, whose are this ring and this cord and this stick?"
2678,bbe,"Then Judah said openly that they were his, and said, She is more upright than I am, for I did not give her to Shelah my son. And he had no more connection with her."
2679,bbe,"And when the time came for her to give birth, it was clear that there were two children in her body."
2680,bbe,"And while she was in the act of giving birth, one of them put out his hand; and the woman who was with her put a red thread round his hand, saying, This one came out first."
2681,bbe,"But then he took his hand back again, and his brother came first to birth: and the woman said, What an opening you have made for yourself! So he was named Perez."
2682,bbe,"And then his brother came out, with the red thread round his hand, and he was named Zerah."
2683,bbe,"Now Joseph was taken down to Egypt; and Potiphar the Egyptian, a captain of high position in Pharaoh's house, got him for a price from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there."
2684,bbe,"And the Lord was with Joseph, and he did well; and he was living in the house of his master the Egyptian."
2685,bbe,"And his master saw that the Lord was with him, making everything he did go well."
2686,bbe,"And having a high opinion of Joseph as his servant, he made him the overseer of his house and gave him control over all he had."
2687,bbe,"And from the time when he made him overseer and gave him control of all his property, the blessing of the Lord was with the Egyptian, because of Joseph; the blessing of the Lord was on all he had, in the house and in the field."
2688,bbe,"And he gave Joseph control of all his property, keeping no account of anything, but only the food which was put before him. Now Joseph was very beautiful in form and face."
2689,bbe,"And after a time, his master's wife, looking on Joseph with desire, said to him, Be my lover."
2690,bbe,"But he would not, and said to her, You see that my master keeps no account of what I do in his house, and has put all his property in my control;"
2691,bbe,"So that no one has more authority in this house than I have; he has kept nothing back from me but you, because you are his wife; how then may I do this great wrong, sinning against God?"
2692,bbe,"And day after day she went on requesting Joseph to come to her and be her lover, but he would not give ear to her."
2693,bbe,Now one day he went into the house to do his work; and not one of the men of the house was inside.
2694,bbe,"And pulling at his coat, she said, Come to my bed; but slipping out of his coat, he went running away."
2695,bbe,"And when she saw that he had got away, letting her keep his coat,"
2696,bbe,"She sent for the men of her house and said to them, See, he has let a Hebrew come here and make sport of us; he came to my bed, and I gave a loud cry;"
2697,bbe,And hearing it he went running out without his coat.
2698,bbe,"And she kept his coat by her, till his master came back."
2699,bbe,"Then she gave him the same story, saying, The Hebrew servant whom you have taken into our house came in to make sport of me;"
2700,bbe,And when I gave a loud cry he went running out without his coat.
2701,bbe,"And hearing his wife's account of what his servant had done, he became very angry."
2702,bbe,"And Joseph's master took him and put him in prison, in the place where the king's prisoners were kept in chains, and he was there in the prison-house."
2703,bbe,"But the Lord was with Joseph, and was good to him, and made the keeper of the prison his friend."
2704,bbe,"And the keeper of the prison put all the prisoners under Joseph's control, and he was responsible for whatever was done there."
2705,bbe,"And the keeper of the prison gave no attention to anything which was under his care, because the Lord was with him; and the Lord made everything he did go well."
2706,bbe,"Now after these things the chief servant who had the care of the wine, and the chief bread-maker in Pharaoh's house, did something against Pharaoh's orders;"
2707,bbe,"And Pharaoh was angry with his two servants, with the chief wine-servant and the chief bread-maker;"
2708,bbe,"And he put them in prison under the care of the captain of the army, in the same prison where Joseph himself was shut up."
2709,bbe,"And the captain put them in Joseph's care, and he did what was needed for them; and they were kept in prison for some time."
2710,bbe,"And these two had a dream on the same night; the chief wine-servant and the chief bread-maker of the king of Egypt, who were in prison, the two of them had dreams with a special sense."
2711,bbe,And in the morning when Joseph came to them he saw that they were looking sad.
2712,bbe,"And he said to the servants of Pharaoh who were in prison with him, Why are you looking so sad?"
2713,bbe,"Then they said to him, We have had a dream, and no one is able to give us the sense. And Joseph said, Does not the sense of dreams come from God? what was your dream?"
2714,bbe,"Then the chief wine-servant gave Joseph an account of his dream, and said, In my dream I saw a vine before me;"
2715,bbe,"And on the vine were three branches; and it seemed as if it put out buds and flowers, and from them came grapes ready for cutting."
2716,bbe,"And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and crushing them into Pharaoh's cup, gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand."
2717,bbe,"Then Joseph said, This is the sense of your dream: the three branches are three days;"
2718,bbe,"After three days Pharaoh will give you honour, and put you back into your place, and you will give him his cup as you did before, when you were his wine-servant."
2719,bbe,"But keep me in mind when things go well for you, and be good to me and say a good word for me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison:"
2720,bbe,For truly I was taken by force from the land of the Hebrews; and I have done nothing for which I might be put in prison.
2721,bbe,"Now when the chief bread-maker saw that the first dream had a good sense, he said to Joseph, I had a dream; and in my dream there were three baskets of white bread on my head;"
2722,bbe,And in the top basket were all sorts of cooked meats for Pharaoh; and the birds were taking them out of the baskets on my head.
2723,bbe,"Then Joseph said, This is the sense of your dream: the three baskets are three days;"
2724,bbe,"After three days Pharaoh will take you out of prison, hanging you on a tree, so that your flesh will be food for birds."
2725,bbe,"Now the third day was Pharaoh's birthday, and he gave a feast for all his servants; and he gave honour to the chief wine-servant and the chief bread-maker among the others."
2726,bbe,And he put the chief wine-servant back in his old place; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
2727,bbe,"But the chief bread-maker was put to death by hanging, as Joseph had said."
2728,bbe,But the wine-servant did not keep Joseph in mind or give a thought to him.
2729,bbe,"Now after two years had gone by, Pharaoh had a dream; and in his dream he was by the side of the Nile;"
2730,bbe,"And out of the Nile came seven cows, good-looking and fat, and their food was the river-grass."
2731,bbe,"And after them seven other cows came out of the Nile, poor-looking and thin; and they were by the side of the other cows."
2732,bbe,And the seven thin cows made a meal of the seven fat cows. Then Pharaoh came out of his sleep.
2733,bbe,"But he went to sleep again and had a second dream, in which he saw seven heads of grain, full and good, all on one stem."
2734,bbe,"And after them came up seven other heads, thin and wasted by the east wind."
2735,bbe,And the seven thin heads made a meal of the good heads. And when Pharaoh was awake he saw it was a dream.
2736,bbe,"And in the morning his spirit was troubled; and he sent for all the wise men of Egypt and all the holy men, and put his dream before them, but no one was able to give him the sense of it."
2737,bbe,"Then the chief wine-servant said to Pharaoh, The memory of my sin comes back to me now;"
2738,bbe,"Pharaoh had been angry with his servants, and had put me in prison in the house of the captain of the army, together with the chief bread-maker;"
2739,bbe,"And we had a dream on the same night, the two of us, and the dreams had a special sense."
2740,bbe,"And there was with us a young Hebrew, the captain's servant, and when we put our dreams before him, he gave us the sense of them."
2741,bbe,"And it came about as he said: I was put back in my place, and the bread-maker was put to death by hanging."
2742,bbe,"Then Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and they took him quickly out of prison; and when his hair had been cut and his dress changed, he came before Pharaoh."
2743,bbe,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have had a dream, and no one is able to give me the sense of it; now it has come to my ears that you are able to give the sense of a dream when it is put before you."
2744,bbe,"Then Joseph said, Without God there will be no answer of peace for Pharaoh."
2745,bbe,"Then Pharaoh said, In my dream I was by the side of the Nile:"
2746,bbe,"And out of the Nile came seven cows, fat and good-looking, and their food was the river-grass;"
2747,bbe,"Then after them came seven other cows, very thin and poor-looking, worse than any I ever saw in the land of Egypt;"
2748,bbe,And the thin cows made a meal of the seven fat cows who came up first;
2749,bbe,And even with the fat cows inside them they seemed as bad as before. And so I came out of my sleep.
2750,bbe,"And again in a dream I saw seven heads of grain, full and good, coming up on one stem:"
2751,bbe,"And then I saw seven other heads, dry, thin, and wasted by the east wind, coming up after them:"
2752,bbe,"And the seven thin heads made a meal of the seven good heads; and I put this dream before the wise men, but not one of them was able to give me the sense of it."
2753,bbe,"Then Joseph said, These two dreams have the same sense: God has made clear to Pharaoh what he is about to do."
2754,bbe,"The seven fat cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years: the two have the same sense."
2755,bbe,"The seven thin and poor-looking cows who came up after them are seven years; and the seven heads of grain, dry and wasted by the east wind, are seven years when there will be no food."
2756,bbe,"As I said to Pharaoh before, God has made clear to him what he is about to do."
2757,bbe,Seven years are coming in which there will be great wealth of grain in Egypt;
2758,bbe,And after that will come seven years when there will not be enough food; and the memory of the good years will go from men's minds; and the land will be made waste by the bad years;
2759,bbe,"And men will have no memory of the good time because of the need which will come after, for it will be very bitter."
2760,bbe,"And this dream came to Pharaoh twice, because this thing is certain, and God will quickly make it come about."
2761,bbe,"And now let Pharaoh make search for a man of wisdom and good sense, and put him in authority over the land of Egypt."
2762,bbe,"Let Pharaoh do this, and let him put overseers over the land of Egypt to put in store a fifth part of the produce of the land in the good years."
2763,bbe,"And let them get together all the food in those good years and make a store of grain under Pharaoh's control for the use of the towns, and let them keep it."
2764,bbe,And let that food be kept in store for the land till the seven bad years which are to come in Egypt; so that the land may not come to destruction through need of food.
2765,bbe,And this seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his servants.
2766,bbe,"Then Pharaoh said to his servants, Where may we get such a man as this, a man in whom is the spirit of God?"
2767,bbe,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Seeing that God has made all this clear to you, there is no other man of such wisdom and good sense as you:"
2768,bbe,"You, then, are to be over my house, and all my people will be ruled by your word: only as king will I be greater than you."
2769,bbe,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have put you over all the land of Egypt."
2770,bbe,"Then Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand, and he had him clothed with the best linen, and put a chain of gold round his neck;"
2771,bbe,"And he made him take his seat in the second of his carriages; and they went before him crying, Make way! So he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt."
2772,bbe,"Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh; and without your order no man may do anything in all the land of Egypt."
2773,bbe,"And Pharaoh gave Joseph the name of Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera, the priest of On, to be his wife. So Joseph went through all the land of Egypt."
2774,bbe,"Now Joseph was thirty years old when he came before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from before the face of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt."
2775,bbe,Now in the seven good years the earth gave fruit in masses.
2776,bbe,"And Joseph got together all the food of those seven years, and made a store of food in the towns: the produce of the fields round every town was stored up in the town."
2777,bbe,"So he got together a store of grain like the sand of the sea; so great a store that after a time he gave up measuring it, for it might not be measured."
2778,bbe,"And before the time of need, Joseph had two sons, to whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera, priest of On, gave birth."
2779,bbe,"And to the first he gave the name Manasseh, for he said, God has taken away from me all memory of my hard life and of my father's house."
2780,bbe,"And to the second he gave the name Ephraim, for he said, God has given me fruit in the land of my sorrow."
2781,bbe,And so the seven good years in Egypt came to an end.
2782,bbe,Then came the first of the seven years of need as Joseph had said: and in every other land they were short of food; but in the land of Egypt there was bread.
2783,bbe,"And when all the land of Egypt was in need of food, the people came crying to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to the people, Go to Joseph, and whatever he says to you, do it."
2784,bbe,"And everywhere on the earth they were short of food; then Joseph, opening all his store-houses, gave the people of Egypt grain for money; so great was the need of food in the land of Egypt."
2785,bbe,"And all lands sent to Egypt, to Joseph, to get grain, for the need was great over all the earth."
2786,bbe,"Now Jacob, hearing that there was grain in Egypt, said to his sons, Why are you looking at one another?"
2787,bbe,"And he said, I have had news that there is grain in Egypt: go down there and get grain for us, so that life and not death may be ours."
2788,bbe,So Joseph's ten brothers went down to get grain from Egypt.
2789,bbe,"But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with them, for fear, as he said, that some evil might come to him."
2790,bbe,And the sons of Israel came with all the others to get grain: for they were very short of food in the land of Canaan.
2791,bbe,"Now Joseph was ruler over all the land, and it was he who gave out the grain to all the people of the land; and Joseph's brothers came before him and went down on their faces to the earth."
2792,bbe,"And when Joseph saw his brothers, it was clear to him who they were, but he made himself strange to them, and talking roughly to them, said, Where do you come from? And they said, From the land of Canaan, to get food."
2793,bbe,"Now though Joseph saw that these were his brothers, they had no idea who he was."
2794,bbe,"Then the memory of his dreams about them came back to Joseph, and he said to them, You have come secretly to see how poor the land is."
2795,bbe,"And they said to him, Not so, my lord: your servants have come with money to get food."
2796,bbe,"We are all one man's sons, we are true men; we have not come with any secret purpose."
2797,bbe,"And he said to them, No, but you have come to see how poor the land is."
2798,bbe,"Then they said, We your servants are twelve brothers, sons of one man in the land of Canaan; the youngest of us is now with our father, and one is dead."
2799,bbe,"And Joseph said, It is as I said; you have come with some secret purpose;"
2800,bbe,"But in this way will you be put to the test: by the life of Pharaoh, you will not go away from this place till your youngest brother comes here."
2801,bbe,"Send one of your number to get your brother, and the rest of you will be kept in prison, so that your words may be tested to see if you are true; if not, by the life of Pharaoh, your purpose is certainly secret."
2802,bbe,So he put them in prison for three days.
2803,bbe,"And on the third day Joseph said to them, Do this, if you would keep your lives: for I am a god-fearing man:"
2804,bbe,"If you are true men, let one of you be kept in prison, while you go and take grain for the needs of your families;"
2805,bbe,"And come back to me with your youngest brother, so that your words may be seen to be true, and you will not be put to death. This is what you are to do."
2806,bbe,"And they said to one another, Truly, we did wrong to our brother, for we saw his grief of mind, and we did not give ear to his prayers; that is why this trouble has come on us."
2807,bbe,"And Reuben said to them, Did I not say to you, Do the child no wrong? but you gave no attention; so now, punishment has come on us for his blood."
2808,bbe,"They were not conscious that the sense of their words was clear to Joseph, for he had been talking to them through one who had knowledge of their language."
2809,bbe,"And turning away from them, he was overcome with weeping; then he went on talking to them again and took Simeon and put chains on him before their eyes."
2810,bbe,"Then Joseph gave orders for their bags to be made full of grain, and for every man's money to be put back into his bag, and for food to be given them for the journey: which was done."
2811,bbe,Then they put the bags of grain on their asses and went away.
2812,bbe,"Now at their night's resting-place one of them, opening his bag to give his ass some food, saw his money in the mouth of the bag."
2813,bbe,"And he said to his brothers, My money has been given back: it is in my bag; then their hearts became full of fear, and turning to one another they said, What is this which God has done to us?"
2814,bbe,"So when they came to Jacob their father, in the land of Canaan, they gave him an account of all their experiences, saying,"
2815,bbe,"The man who is the ruler of the country was rough with us and put us in prison, saying that we had come with a secret evil purpose."
2816,bbe,"And we said to him, We are true men, we have no evil designs;"
2817,bbe,"We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is dead, and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan."
2818,bbe,"And the ruler of the land said, In this way I may be certain that you are true men; let one of you be kept here with me, while you go and take grain for the needs of your families;"
2819,bbe,"And come back to me with your youngest brother: then I will be certain that you are true men, and I will give your brother back to you and let you do trade in the land."
2820,bbe,"And when they took the grain out of their bags, it was seen that every man's parcel of money was in his bag; and when they and their father saw the money, they were full of fear."
2821,bbe,"And Jacob their father said to them, You have taken my children from me: Joseph is gone and Simeon is gone, and now you would take Benjamin away; all these things have come on me."
2822,bbe,"And Reuben said, Put my two sons to death if I do not come back to you with him; let him be in my care and I will give him safely back to you."
2823,bbe,"And he said, I will not let my son go down with you; for his brother is dead and he is all I have: if evil overtakes him on the journey, then through you will my grey head go down to the underworld in sorrow."
2824,bbe,Now the land was in bitter need of food.
2825,bbe,"And when the grain which they had got in Egypt was all used up, their father said to them, Go again and get us a little food."
2826,bbe,"And Judah said to him, The man said to us with an oath, You are not to come before me again without your brother."
2827,bbe,"If you will let our brother go with us, we will go down and get food:"
2828,bbe,"But if you will not send him, we will not go down: for the man said to us, You are not to come before me if your brother is not with you."
2829,bbe,"And Israel said, Why were you so cruel to me as to say to him that you had a brother?"
2830,bbe,"And they said, The man put a number of questions to us about ourselves and our family, saying, Is your father still living? have you another brother? And we had to give him answers; how were we to have any idea that he would say, Come back with your brother?"
2831,bbe,"Then Judah said to Israel, his father, Send the boy with me, and let us be up and going, so that we and you and our little ones may not come to destruction."
2832,bbe,"Put him into my care and make me responsible for him: if I do not give him safely back to you, let mine be the sin for ever."
2833,bbe,"Truly, if we had not let the time go by, we might have come back again by now."
2834,bbe,"Then their father Israel said to them, If it has to be so, then do this: take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels to give the man, perfumes and honey and spices and nuts:"
2835,bbe,"And take twice as much money with you; that is to say, take back the money which was put in your bags, for it may have been an error;"
2836,bbe,And take your brother and go back to the man:
2837,bbe,"And may God, the Ruler of all, give you mercy before the man, so that he may give you back your other brother and Benjamin. If my children are to be taken from me; there is no help for it."
2838,bbe,"So they took what their father said for the man, and twice as much money in their hands, and Benjamin, and went on their journey to Egypt, and came before Joseph."
2839,bbe,"And when Joseph saw Benjamin, he said to his chief servant, Take these men into my house, and make ready a meal, for they will take food with me in the middle of the day."
2840,bbe,"And the servant did as Joseph said, and took the men into Joseph's house."
2841,bbe,"Now the men were full of fear because they had been taken into Joseph's house and they said, It is because of the money which was put back in our bags the first time; he is looking for something against us, so that he may come down on us and take us and our asses for his use."
2842,bbe,"So they went up to Joseph's chief servant at the door of the house,"
2843,bbe,"And said, O my lord, we only came down the first time to get food;"
2844,bbe,"And when we came to our night's resting-place, on opening our bags we saw that every man's money was in the mouth of his bag, all our money in full weight: and we have it with us to give it back;"
2845,bbe,"As well as more money, with which to get food: we have no idea who put our money in our bags."
2846,bbe,"Then the servant said, Peace be with you: have no fear: your God, even the God of your father, has put wealth in your bags for you: I had your money. Then he let Simeon come out to them."
2847,bbe,"And the servant took them into Joseph's house, and gave them water for washing their feet; and he gave their asses food."
2848,bbe,And they got ready the things for Joseph before he came in the middle of the day: for word was given to them that they were to have a meal there.
2849,bbe,"And when Joseph came in, they gave him the things which they had for him, and went down to the earth before him."
2850,bbe,"And he said, How are you? is your father well, the old man of whom you were talking to me? is he still living?"
2851,bbe,"And they said, Your servant, our father, is well, he is still living. And they went down on their faces before him."
2852,bbe,"Then, lifting up his eyes, he saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother's son, and he said, Is this your youngest brother of whom you gave me word? And he said, God be good to you, my son."
2853,bbe,"Then Joseph's heart went out to his brother, and he went quickly into his room, for he was overcome with weeping."
2854,bbe,"Then, after washing his face, he came out, and controlling his feelings said, Put food before us."
2855,bbe,"And they put a meal ready for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who were with him by themselves; because the Egyptians may not take food with the Hebrews, for that would make them unclean."
2856,bbe,"And they were all given their seats before him in order of birth, from the oldest to the youngest: so that they were looking at one another in wonder."
2857,bbe,"And Joseph sent food to them from his table, but he sent five times as much to Benjamin as to any of the others. And they took wine freely with him."
2858,bbe,"Then he gave orders to the servant who was over his house, saying, Put as much food into the men's bags as will go into them, and put every man's money in the mouth of his bag;"
2859,bbe,"And put my cup, my silver cup, in the youngest one's bag, with his money. So he did as Joseph said."
2860,bbe,"And at dawn the men, with their asses, were sent away."
2861,bbe,"And when they had gone only a little way out of the town, Joseph said to the servant who was over his house, Go after them; and when you overtake them, say to them, Why have you done evil in reward for good?"
2862,bbe,"Is not this the cup from which my lord takes wine and by which he gets knowledge of the future? Truly, you have done evil."
2863,bbe,So he overtook them and said these words to them.
2864,bbe,"And they said to him, Why does my lord say such words as these? far be it from your servants to do such a thing:"
2865,bbe,"See, the money which was in the mouth of our bags we gave back to you when we came again from Canaan: how then might we take silver or gold from your lord's house?"
2866,bbe,"If it comes to light that any of your servants has done this, let him be put to death, and we will be your lord's servants."
2867,bbe,"And he said, Let it be as you say: he in whose bag it is seen will become my servant; and you will not be responsible."
2868,bbe,Then every man quickly got his bag down and undid it.
2869,bbe,"And he made a search, starting with the oldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was in Benjamin's bag."
2870,bbe,Then in bitter grief they put the bags on the asses again and went back to the town.
2871,bbe,So Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house; and he was still there: and they went down on their faces before him.
2872,bbe,"And Joseph said, What is this thing which you have done? had you no thought that such a man as I would have power to see what is secret?"
2873,bbe,"And Judah said, What are we to say to my lord? how may we put ourselves right in his eyes? God has made clear the sin of your servants: now we are in your hands, we and the man in whose bag your cup was seen."
2874,bbe,"Then he said, Far be it from me to do so: but the man who had my cup will be my servant; and you may go back to your father in peace."
2875,bbe,"Then Judah came near him, and said, Let your servant say a word in my lord's ears, and let not your wrath be burning against your servant: for you are in the place of Pharaoh to us."
2876,bbe,"My lord said to his servants, Have you a father or a brother?"
2877,bbe,"And we said to my lord, We have an old father and a young child, whom he had when he was old; his brother is dead and he is the only son of his mother, and is very dear to his father."
2878,bbe,"And you said to your servants, Let him come down to me with you, so that I may see him."
2879,bbe,"And we said to my lord, His father will not let him go; for if he went away his father would come to his death."
2880,bbe,"But you said to your servants, If your youngest brother does not come with you, you will not see my face again."
2881,bbe,"And when we went back to your servant, our father, we gave him an account of my lord's words."
2882,bbe,"And our father said, Go again and get us a little food."
2883,bbe,"And we said, Only if our youngest brother goes with us will we go down; for we may not see the man's face again if our youngest brother is not with us."
2884,bbe,"And our father said to us, You have knowledge that my wife gave me two sons;"
2885,bbe,"The one went away from me, and I said, Truly he has come to a violent death; and from that time I have not seen him,"
2886,bbe,"If now you take this one from me, and some evil comes to him, you will make my grey head go down in sorrow to the underworld."
2887,bbe,"If then I go back to your servant, my father, without the boy, because his life and the boy's life are one,"
2888,bbe,"When he sees that the boy is not with us, he will come to his death, and our father's grey head will go down in sorrow to the underworld."
2889,bbe,"For I made myself responsible for the boy to my father, saying, If I do not give him safely back to you, let mine be the sin for ever."
2890,bbe,"So now let me be my lord's servant here in place of the boy, and let him go back with his brothers."
2891,bbe,"For how may I go back to my father without the boy, and see the evil which will come on my father?"
2892,bbe,"Then Joseph, unable to keep back his feelings before those who were with him, gave orders for everyone to be sent away, and no one was present when he made clear to his brothers who he was."
2893,bbe,"And so loud was his weeping, that it came to the ears of the Egyptians and all Pharaoh's house."
2894,bbe,"And Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph: is my father still living? But his brothers were not able to give him an answer for they were troubled before him."
2895,bbe,"Then Joseph said to his brothers, Come near to me. And they came near, And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom you sent into Egypt."
2896,bbe,"Now do not be troubled or angry with yourselves for sending me away, because God sent me before you to be the saviour of your lives."
2897,bbe,"For these two years have been years of need, and there are still five more years to come in which there will be no ploughing or cutting of grain."
2898,bbe,God sent me before you to keep you and yours living on earth so that you might become a great nation.
2899,bbe,"So now it was not you who sent me here, but God: and he has made me as a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt."
2900,bbe,"Now go quickly to my father, and say to him, Your son Joseph says, God has made me ruler over all the land of Egypt: come down to me straight away:"
2901,bbe,"The land of Goshen will be your living-place, and you will be near me; you and your children and your children's children, and your flocks and herds and all you have:"
2902,bbe,"And there I will take care of you, so that you and your family may not be in need, for there are still five bad years to come."
2903,bbe,"Now truly, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is my mouth which says these things to you."
2904,bbe,Give my father word of all my glory in Egypt and of all you have seen; and come back quickly with my father.
2905,bbe,"Then, weeping, he took Benjamin in his arms, and Benjamin himself was weeping on Joseph's neck."
2906,bbe,"Then he gave a kiss to all his brothers, weeping over them; and after that his brothers had no fear of talking to him."
2907,bbe,"And news of these things went through Pharaoh's house, and it was said that Joseph's brothers were come; and it seemed good to Pharaoh and his servants."
2908,bbe,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to your brothers, Put your goods on your beasts and go back to the land of Canaan;"
2909,bbe,"And get your father and your families and come back to me: and I will give you all the good things of Egypt, and the fat of the land will be your food."
2910,bbe,"And say to them, This you are to do: take carts from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and get your father and come back."
2911,bbe,"And take no thought for your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours."
2912,bbe,"And the children of Israel did as he said; and Joseph gave them carts as had been ordered by Pharaoh, and food for their journey."
2913,bbe,To every one of them he gave three changes of clothing; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred bits of silver and five changes of clothing.
2914,bbe,"And to his father he sent ten asses with good things from Egypt on their backs, and ten she-asses with grain and bread and food for his father on the journey."
2915,bbe,"And he sent his brothers on their way, and said to them, See that you have no argument on the road."
2916,bbe,"So they went up from Egypt and came to the land of Canaan, to their father Jacob."
2917,bbe,"And they said to him, Joseph is living, and is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And at this word Jacob was quite overcome, for he had no faith in it."
2918,bbe,"And they gave him an account of everything Joseph had said to them; and when he saw the carts which Joseph had sent for them, his spirit came back to him:"
2919,bbe,"And Israel said, It is enough: Joseph my son is still living; I will go and see him before my death."
2920,bbe,"And Israel went on his journey with all he had, and came to Beer-sheba, where he made offerings to the God of his father Isaac."
2921,bbe,"And God said to Israel in a night-vision, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I."
2922,bbe,"And he said, I am God, the God of your father: go down to Egypt without fear, for I will make a great nation of you there:"
2923,bbe,"I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will see that you come back again, and at your death Joseph will put his hands on your eyes."
2924,bbe,Then Jacob went on from Beer-sheba; and the sons of Jacob took their father and their little ones and their wives in the carts which Pharaoh had sent for them.
2925,bbe,"And they took their cattle and all the goods which they had got in the land of Canaan, and came to Egypt, even Jacob and all his seed:"
2926,bbe,"His sons and his sons' sons, his daughters and his daughters' sons and all his family he took with him into Egypt."
2927,bbe,"And these are the names of the children of Israel who came into Egypt, even Jacob and all his sons: Reuben, Jacob's oldest son;"
2928,bbe,And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch and Pallu and Hezron and Carmi;
2929,bbe,"And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul, the son of a woman of Canaan;"
2930,bbe,"And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari;"
2931,bbe,And the sons of Judah: Er and Onan and Shelah and Perez and Zerah: but Er and Onan had come to their death in the land of Canaan; and the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
2932,bbe,And the sons of Issachar: Tola and Puah and Job and Shimron;
2933,bbe,And the sons of Zebulun: Sered and Elon and Jahleel;
2934,bbe,"All these, together with his daughter Dinah, were the children of Leah, whom Jacob had by her in Paddan-aram; they were thirty-three in number."
2935,bbe,"And the sons of Gad: Ziphion and Haggi, Shuni and Ezbon, Eri and Arodi and Areli;"
2936,bbe,"And the sons of Asher: Jimnah and Ishvah and Ishvi and Beriah, and Sarah, their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel."
2937,bbe,"These are the children of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah, and Jacob had these sixteen children by her."
2938,bbe,The sons of Jacob's wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
2939,bbe,"And Joseph had Manasseh and Ephraim in the land of Egypt, by Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera, priest of On."
2940,bbe,"And the sons of Benjamin were Belah and Becher and Ashbel, Gera and Naaman, Ehi and Rosh, Muppim and Huppim and Ard."
2941,bbe,"All these were the children of Rachel whom Jacob had by her, fourteen persons."
2942,bbe,And the son of Dan was Hushim.
2943,bbe,And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel and Guni and Jezer and Shillem.
2944,bbe,"These were the children of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel, seven persons."
2945,bbe,"All the persons who came with Jacob into Egypt, the offspring of his body, were sixty-six, without taking into account the wives of Jacob's sons."
2946,bbe,And the sons of Joseph whom he had in Egypt were two. Seventy persons of the family of Jacob came into Egypt.
2947,bbe,"Now he had sent Judah before him to Goshen, to get word from Joseph; and so they came to the land of Goshen."
2948,bbe,"And Joseph got his carriage ready and went to Goshen for the meeting with his father; and when he came before him, he put his arms round his neck, weeping."
2949,bbe,"And Israel said to Joseph, Now that I have seen you living again, I am ready for death."
2950,bbe,"And Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's people, I will go and give the news to Pharaoh, and say to him, My brothers and my father's people, from the land of Canaan, have come to me;"
2951,bbe,"And these men are keepers of sheep and owners of cattle, and have with them their flocks and their herds and all they have."
2952,bbe,"Now when Pharaoh sends for you and says, What is your business?"
2953,bbe,"You are to say, Your servants have been keepers of cattle from our early days up to now, like our fathers; in this way you will be able to have the land of Goshen for yourselves; because keepers of sheep are unclean in the eyes of the Egyptians."
2954,bbe,"Then Joseph went to Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brothers with their flocks and their herds and all they have, are come from Canaan, and are now in the land of Goshen."
2955,bbe,And he took five of his brothers to Pharaoh.
2956,bbe,"And Pharaoh said to them, What is your business? And they said, Your servants are keepers of sheep, as our fathers were before us."
2957,bbe,"And they said to Pharaoh, We have come to make a living in this land, because we have no grass for our flocks in the land of Canaan; so now let your servants make a place for themselves in the land of Goshen."
2958,bbe,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Let them have the land of Goshen; and if there are any able men among them, put them over my cattle."
2959,bbe,"And Jacob and his sons came to Joseph in Egypt, and when word of it came to the ears of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, he said to Joseph, Your father and brothers have come to you; all the land of Egypt is before you; let your father and your brothers have the best of the land for their resting-place."
2960,bbe,"Then Joseph made his father Jacob come before Pharaoh, and Jacob gave him his blessing."
2961,bbe,"And Pharaoh said to him, How old are you?"
2962,bbe,"And Jacob said, The years of my wanderings have been a hundred and thirty; small in number and full of sorrow have been the years of my life, and less than the years of the wanderings of my fathers."
2963,bbe,"And Jacob gave Pharaoh his blessing, and went out from before him."
2964,bbe,"And Joseph made a place for his father and his brothers, and gave them a heritage in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had given orders."
2965,bbe,"And Joseph took care of his father and his brothers and all his father's people, giving them food for the needs of their families."
2966,bbe,"Now there was no food to be had in all the land, so that all Egypt and Canaan were wasted from need of food."
2967,bbe,"And all the money in Egypt and in the land of Canaan which had been given for grain, came into the hands of Joseph: and he put it in Pharaoh's house."
2968,bbe,"And when all the money in Egypt and Canaan was gone, the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, Give us bread; would you have us come to destruction before your eyes? for we have no more money."
2969,bbe,"And Joseph said, Give me your cattle; I will give you grain in exchange for your cattle if your money is all gone."
2970,bbe,"So they took their cattle to Joseph and he gave them bread in exchange for their horses and flocks and herds and asses, so all that year he gave them food in exchange for their cattle."
2971,bbe,"And when that year was ended, they came to him in the second year, and said, We may not keep it from our lord's knowledge that all our money is gone, and all the herds of cattle are my lord's; there is nothing more to give my lord but our bodies and our land;"
2972,bbe,"Are we to come to destruction before your eyes, we and our land? take us and our land and give us bread; and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh; and give us seed so that we may have life and the land may not become waste."
2973,bbe,"So Joseph got all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh; for every Egyptian gave up his land in exchange for food, because of their great need; so all the land became Pharaoh's."
2974,bbe,"And as for the people, he made servants of them, town by town, from one end of Egypt to the other."
2975,bbe,"Only he did not take the land of the priests, for the priests had their food given them by Pharaoh, and having what Pharaoh gave them, they had no need to give up their land."
2976,bbe,"Then Joseph said to the people, I have made you and your land this day the property of Pharaoh; here is seed for you to put in your fields."
2977,bbe,"And when the grain is cut, you are to give a fifth part to Pharaoh, and four parts will be yours for seed and food, and for your families and your little ones."
2978,bbe,"And they said to him, Truly you have kept us from death; may we have grace in your eyes, and we will be Pharaoh's servants."
2979,bbe,"Then Joseph made a law which is in force to this day, that Pharaoh was to have the fifth part; only the land of the priests did not become his."
2980,bbe,"And so Israel was living among the Egyptians in the land of Goshen; and they got property there, and became very great in numbers and in wealth."
2981,bbe,And Jacob was living in the land of Goshen for seventeen years; so the years of his life were a hundred and forty-seven.
2982,bbe,"And the time of his death came near, and he sent for his son Joseph and said to him, If now I am dear to you, put your hand under my leg and take an oath that you will not put me to rest in Egypt;"
2983,bbe,"But when I go to my fathers, you are to take me out of Egypt and put me to rest in their last resting-place. And he said, I will do so."
2984,bbe,"And he said, Take an oath to me; and he took an oath to him: and Israel gave worship on the bed's head."
2985,bbe,"Now after these things, word came to Joseph that his father was ill: and he took with him his sons Manasseh and Ephraim."
2986,bbe,"And when they said to Jacob, Your son Joseph is coming to see you: then Israel, getting all his strength together, had himself lifted up in his bed."
2987,bbe,"And Jacob said to Joseph, God, the Ruler of all, came to me in a vision at Luz in the land of Canaan, and gave me his blessing,"
2988,bbe,"And said to me, Truly, I will make you fertile and give you increase and will make of you a great family of nations: and I will give this land to your seed after you to be their heritage for ever."
2989,bbe,"And now your two sons who came to birth in Egypt before I came to you here, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, in the same way as Reuben and Simeon are."
2990,bbe,"And any other offspring which you have after them, will be yours, and will be named after their brothers in their heritage."
2991,bbe,"And as for me, when I came from Paddan, death overtook Rachel on the way, when we were still some distance from Ephrath; and I put her to rest there on the road to Ephrath, which is Beth-lehem."
2992,bbe,"Then Israel, looking at Joseph's sons, said, Who are these?"
2993,bbe,"And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me in this land. And he said, Let them come near me, and I will give them a blessing."
2994,bbe,"Now because Israel was old, his eyes were no longer clear, and he was not able to see. So he made them come near to him, and he gave them a kiss, folding them in his arms."
2995,bbe,"And Israel said to Joseph, I had no hope of seeing your face again, but God in his mercy has let me see you and your children."
2996,bbe,"Then Joseph took them from between his knees, and went down on his face to the earth."
2997,bbe,"Then taking Ephraim with his right hand, Joseph put him at Israel's left side, and with his left hand he put Manasseh at Israel's right side, placing them near him."
2998,bbe,"And Israel, stretching out his right hand, put it on the head of Ephraim, the younger, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands on purpose, for Manasseh was the older."
2999,bbe,"And he gave Joseph a blessing, saying, May the God to whom my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, gave worship, the God who has taken care of me all my life till this day,"
3000,bbe,"The angel who has been my saviour from all evil, send his blessing on these children: and let my name and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, be given to them; and let them become a great nation in the earth."
3001,bbe,"Now when Joseph saw that his father had put his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it did not seem right to him; and lifting his father's hand he would have put it on the head of Manasseh."
3002,bbe,"And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this is the older; put your right hand on his head."
3003,bbe,"But his father would not, saying, I am doing it on purpose, my son; he will certainly become a nation and a great one; but his younger brother will be greater than he, and his seed will become a great family of nations."
3004,bbe,"So he gave them his blessing that day, saying, You will be the sign of blessing in Israel, for they will say, May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh; and he put Ephraim before Manasseh."
3005,bbe,"Then Israel said to Joseph, Now my death is near; but God will be with you, guiding you back to the land of your fathers."
3006,bbe,"And I have given you more than your brothers, even Shechem as your heritage, which I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow."
3007,bbe,"And Jacob sent for his sons, and said, Come together, all of you, so that I may give you news of your fate in future times."
3008,bbe,"Come near, O sons of Jacob, and give ear to the words of Israel your father."
3009,bbe,"Reuben, you are my oldest son, the first-fruit of my strength, first in pride and first in power:"
3010,bbe,"But because you were uncontrolled, the first place will not be yours; for you went up to your father's bed, even his bride-bed, and made it unclean."
3011,bbe,Simeon and Levi are brothers; deceit and force are their secret designs.
3012,bbe,"Take no part in their secrets, O my soul; keep far away, O my heart, from their meetings; for in their wrath they put men to death, and for their pleasure even oxen were wounded."
3013,bbe,"A curse on their passion for it was bitter; and on their wrath for it was cruel. I will let their heritage in Jacob be broken up, driving them from their places in Israel."
3014,bbe,"To you, Judah, will your brothers give praise: your hand will be on the neck of your haters; your father's sons will go down to the earth before you."
3015,bbe,"Judah is a young lion; like a lion full of meat you have become great, my son; now he takes his rest like a lion stretched out and like an old lion; by whom will his sleep be broken?"
3016,bbe,"The rod of authority will not be taken from Judah, and he will not be without a law-giver, till he comes who has the right to it, and the peoples will put themselves under his rule."
3017,bbe,"Knotting his ass's cord to the vine, and his young ass to the best vine; washing his robe in wine, and his clothing in the blood of grapes:"
3018,bbe,"His eyes will be dark with wine, and his teeth white with milk."
3019,bbe,"The resting-place of Zebulun will be by the sea, and he will be a harbour for ships; the edge of his land will be by Zidon."
3020,bbe,Issachar is a strong ass stretched out among the flocks:
3021,bbe,And he saw that rest was good and the land was pleasing; so he let them put weights on his back and became a servant.
3022,bbe,"Dan will be the judge of his people, as one of the tribes of Israel."
3023,bbe,"May Dan be a snake in the way, a horned snake by the road, biting the horse's foot so that the horseman has a fall."
3024,bbe,"I have been waiting for your salvation, O Lord."
3025,bbe,"Gad, an army will come against him, but he will come down on them in their flight."
3026,bbe,Asher's bread is fat; he gives delicate food for kings.
3027,bbe,"Naphtali is a roe let loose, giving fair young ones."
3028,bbe,"Joseph is a young ox, whose steps are turned to the fountain;"
3029,bbe,"He was troubled by the archers; they sent out their arrows against him, cruelly wounding him:"
3030,bbe,"But their bows were broken by a strong one, and the cords of their arms were cut by the Strength of Jacob, by the name of the Stone of Israel:"
3031,bbe,"Even by the God of your father, who will be your help, and by the Ruler of all, who will make you full with blessings from heaven on high, blessings of the deep stretched out under the earth, blessings of the breasts and of the fertile body:"
3032,bbe,"Blessings of sons, old and young, to the father: blessings of the oldest mountains and the fruit of the eternal hills: let them come on the head of Joseph, on the crown of him who was separate from his brothers."
3033,bbe,"Benjamin is a wolf, searching for meat: in the morning he takes his food, and in the evening he makes division of what he has taken."
3034,bbe,"These are the twelve tribes of Israel: and these are the words their father said to them, blessing them; to every one he gave his blessing."
3035,bbe,"And he gave orders to them, saying, Put me to rest with my people and with my fathers, in the hollow of the rock in the field of Ephron the Hittite,"
3036,bbe,"In the rock in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in the land of Canaan, which Abraham got from Ephron the Hittite, to be his resting-place."
3037,bbe,"There Abraham and Sarah his wife were put to rest, and there they put Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I put Leah to rest."
3038,bbe,In the rock in the field which was got for a price from the people of Heth.
3039,bbe,"And when Jacob had come to the end of these words to his sons, stretching himself on his bed, he gave up his spirit, and went the way of his people."
3040,bbe,"And Joseph put his head down on his father's face, weeping and kissing him."
3041,bbe,"And Joseph gave orders to his servants who had the necessary knowledge, to make his father's body ready, folding it in linen with spices, and they did so."
3042,bbe,And the forty days needed for making the body ready went by: and there was weeping for him among the Egyptians for seventy days.
3043,bbe,"And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph said to the servants of Pharaoh, If now you have love for me, say these words to Pharaoh:"
3044,bbe,"My father made me take an oath, saying, When I am dead, put me to rest in the place I have made ready for myself in the land of Canaan. So now let me go and put my father in his last resting-place, and I will come back again."
3045,bbe,"And Pharaoh said, Go up and put your father to rest, as you gave your oath to him."
3046,bbe,"So Joseph went up to put his father in his last resting-place; and with him went all the servants of Pharaoh, and the chief men of his house and all the chiefs of the land of Egypt,"
3047,bbe,"And all the family of Joseph, and his brothers and his father's people: only their little ones and their flocks and herds they did not take with them from the land of Goshen."
3048,bbe,"And carriages went up with him and horsemen, a great army."
3049,bbe,"And they came to the grain-floor of Atad on the other side of Jordan, and there they gave the last honours to Jacob, with great and bitter sorrow, weeping for their father for seven days."
3050,bbe,"And when the people of the land, the people of Canaan, at the grain-floor of Atad, saw their grief, they said, Great is the grief of the Egyptians: so the place was named Abel-mizraim, on the other side of Jordan."
3051,bbe,So his sons did as he had given them orders to do:
3052,bbe,"For they took him into the land of Canaan and put him to rest in the hollow rock in the field of Machpelah, which Abraham got with the field, for a resting-place, from Ephron the Hittite at Mamre."
3053,bbe,"And when his father had been put to rest, Joseph and his brothers and all who had gone with him, went back to Egypt."
3054,bbe,"Now after the death of their father, Joseph's brothers said to themselves, It may be that Joseph's heart will be turned against us, and he will give us punishment for all the evil which we did to him."
3055,bbe,"So they sent word to Joseph, saying, Your father, before his death, gave us orders, saying,"
3056,bbe,"You are to say to Joseph, Let the wrongdoing of your brothers be overlooked, and the evil they did to you: now, if it is your pleasure, let the sin of the servants of your father's God have forgiveness. And at these words, Joseph was overcome with weeping."
3057,bbe,"Then his brothers went, and falling at his feet, said, Truly, we are your servants."
3058,bbe,"And Joseph said, Have no fear: am I in the place of God?"
3059,bbe,"As for you, it was in your mind to do me evil, but God has given a happy outcome, the salvation of numbers of people, as you see today."
3060,bbe,"So now, have no fear: for I will take care of you and your little ones. So he gave them comfort with kind words."
3061,bbe,Now Joseph and all his father's family went on living in Egypt: and the years of Joseph's life were a hundred and ten.
3062,bbe,"And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: and the children of Machir, the son of Manasseh, came to birth on Joseph's knees."
3063,bbe,"Then Joseph said to his brothers, The time of my death has come; but God will keep you in mind and take you out of this land into the land which he gave by his oath to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob."
3064,bbe,"Then Joseph made the children of Israel take an oath, saying, God will certainly give effect to his word, and you are to take my bones away from here."
3065,bbe,"So Joseph came to his death, being a hundred and ten years old: and they made his body ready, and he was put in a chest in Egypt."
3066,dby,In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
3067,dby,"And the earth was waste and empty, and darkness was on the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters."
3068,dby,"And God said, Let there be light. And there was light."
3069,dby,And God saw the light that it was good; and God divided between the light and the darkness.
3070,dby,"And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening, and there was morning -- the first day."
3071,dby,"And God said, Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it be a division between waters and waters."
3072,dby,"And God made the expanse, and divided between the waters that are under the expanse and the waters that are above the expanse; and it was so."
3073,dby,"And God called the expanse Heavens. And there was evening, and there was morning -- a second day."
3074,dby,"And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together to one place, and let the dry [land] appear. And it was so."
3075,dby,"And God called the dry [land] Earth, and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas. And God saw that it was good."
3076,dby,"And God said, Let the earth cause grass to spring up, herb producing seed, fruit-trees yielding fruit after their kind, the seed of which is in them, on the earth. And it was so."
3077,dby,"And the earth brought forth grass, herb producing seed after its kind, and trees yielding fruit, the seed of which is in them, after their kind. And God saw that it was good."
3078,dby,"And there was evening, and there was morning -- a third day."
3079,dby,"And God said, Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens, to divide between the day and the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;"
3080,dby,"and let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens, to give light on the earth. And it was so."
3081,dby,"And God made the two great lights, the great light to rule the day, and the small light to rule the night, -- and the stars."
3082,dby,"And God set them in the expanse of the heavens, to give light on the earth,"
3083,dby,"and to rule during the day and during the night, and to divide between the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good."
3084,dby,"And there was evening, and there was morning -- a fourth day."
3085,dby,"And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living souls, and let fowl fly above the earth in the expanse of the heavens."
3086,dby,"And God created the great sea monsters, and every living soul that moves with which the waters swarm, after their kind, and every winged fowl after its kind. And God saw that it was good."
3087,dby,"And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply on the earth."
3088,dby,"And there was evening, and there was morning -- a fifth day."
3089,dby,"And God said, Let the earth bring forth living souls after their kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth, after their kind. And it was so."
3090,dby,"And God made the beast of the earth after its kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing of the ground after its kind. And God saw that it was good."
3091,dby,"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over the whole earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth on the earth."
3092,dby,"And God created Man in his image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."
3093,dby,"And God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over every animal that moveth on the earth."
3094,dby,"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb producing seed that is on the whole earth, and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree producing seed: it shall be food for you;"
3095,dby,"and to every animal of the earth, and to every fowl of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth on the earth, in which is a living soul, every green herb for food. And it was so."
3096,dby,"And God saw everything that he had made, and behold it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning -- the sixth day."
3097,dby,And the heavens and the earth and all their host were finished.
3098,dby,And God had finished on the seventh day his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
3099,dby,"And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it, because that on it he rested from all his work which God had created in making it."
3100,dby,"These are the histories of the heavens and the earth, when they were created, in the day that Jehovah Elohim made earth and heavens,"
3101,dby,"and every shrub of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew; for Jehovah Elohim had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to till the ground."
3102,dby,"But a mist went up from the earth, and moistened the whole surface of the ground."
3103,dby,"And Jehovah Elohim formed Man, dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and Man became a living soul."
3104,dby,"And Jehovah Elohim planted a garden in Eden eastward, and there put Man whom he had formed."
3105,dby,"And out of the ground Jehovah Elohim made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; and the tree of life, in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil."
3106,dby,"And a river went out of Eden, to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four main streams."
3107,dby,"The name of the one is Pison: that is it which surrounds the whole land of Havilah, where the gold is."
3108,dby,And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and the onyx stone are there.
3109,dby,And the name of the second river is Gihon: that is it which surrounds the whole land of Cush.
3110,dby,"And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which flows forward toward Asshur. And the fourth river, that is Euphrates."
3111,dby,"And Jehovah Elohim took Man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to till it and to guard it."
3112,dby,"And Jehovah Elohim commanded Man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou shalt freely eat;"
3113,dby,"but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt certainly die."
3114,dby,"And Jehovah Elohim said, It is not good that Man should be alone; I will make him a helpmate, his like."
3115,dby,"And out of the ground Jehovah Elohim had formed every animal of the field and all fowl of the heavens, and brought [them] to Man, to see what he would call them; and whatever Man called each living soul, that was its name."
3116,dby,"And Man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but as for Adam, he found no helpmate, his like."
3117,dby,And Jehovah Elohim caused a deep sleep to fall upon Man; and he slept. And he took one of his ribs and closed up flesh in its stead.
3118,dby,And Jehovah Elohim built the rib that he had taken from Man into a woman; and brought her to Man.
3119,dby,"And Man said, This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man."
3120,dby,"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave to his wife; and they shall become one flesh."
3121,dby,"And they were both naked, Man and his wife, and were not ashamed."
3122,dby,"And the serpent was more crafty than any animal of the field which Jehovah Elohim had made. And it said to the woman, Is it even so, that God has said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?"
3123,dby,"And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden;"
3124,dby,"but of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, God has said, Ye shall not eat of it, and ye shall not touch it, lest ye die."
3125,dby,"And the serpent said to the woman, Ye will not certainly die;"
3126,dby,"but God knows that in the day ye eat of it, your eyes will be opened, and ye will be as God, knowing good and evil."
3127,dby,"And the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a pleasure for the eyes, and the tree was to be desired to give intelligence; and she took of its fruit, and ate, and gave also to her husband with her, and he ate."
3128,dby,"And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons."
3129,dby,"And they heard the voice of Jehovah Elohim, walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah Elohim, in the midst of the trees of the garden."
3130,dby,"And Jehovah Elohim called to Man, and said to him, Where art thou?"
3131,dby,"And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I feared, because I am naked; and I hid myself."
3132,dby,"And he said, Who told thee that thou art naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee not to eat?"
3133,dby,"And Man said, The woman, whom thou hast given [to be] with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate."
3134,dby,"And Jehovah Elohim said to the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate."
3135,dby,"And Jehovah Elohim said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this, be thou cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field. On thy belly shalt thou go, and eat dust all the days of thy life."
3136,dby,"And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; he shall crush thy head, and thou shalt crush his heel."
3137,dby,"To the woman he said, I will greatly increase thy travail and thy pregnancy; with pain thou shalt bear children; and to thy husband shall be thy desire, and he shall rule over thee."
3138,dby,"And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed be the ground on thy account; with toil shalt thou eat [of] it all the days of thy life;"
3139,dby,and thorns and thistles shall it yield thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.
3140,dby,"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, until thou return to the ground: for out of it wast thou taken. For dust thou art; and unto dust shalt thou return."
3141,dby,And Man called his wife's name Eve; because she is the mother of all living.
3142,dby,"And Jehovah Elohim made Adam and his wife coats of skin, and clothed them."
3143,dby,"And Jehovah Elohim said, Behold, Man is become as one of us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he stretch out his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever ...!"
3144,dby,"Therefore Jehovah Elohim sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken."
3145,dby,"And he drove out Man; and he set the Cherubim, and the flame of the flashing sword, toward the east of the garden of Eden, to guard the way to the tree of life."
3146,dby,"And Man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have acquired a man with Jehovah."
3147,dby,"And she further bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a shepherd, but Cain was a husbandman."
3148,dby,And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to Jehovah.
3149,dby,"And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat. And Jehovah looked upon Abel, and on his offering;"
3150,dby,"and upon Cain, and on his offering, he did not look. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell."
3151,dby,"And Jehovah said to Cain, Why art thou angry, and why is thy countenance fallen?"
3152,dby,"If thou doest well, will not [thy countenance] look up [with confidence]? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door; and unto thee [shall be] his desire, and thou shalt rule over him."
3153,dby,"And Cain spoke to Abel his brother, and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him."
3154,dby,"And Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother's keeper?"
3155,dby,"And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood is crying to me from the ground."
3156,dby,"And now be thou cursed from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand."
3157,dby,"When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield thee its strength; a wanderer and fugitive shalt thou be on the earth."
3158,dby,"And Cain said to Jehovah, My punishment is too great to be borne."
3159,dby,"Behold, thou hast driven me this day from the face of the ground, and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a wanderer and fugitive on the earth; and it will come to pass, [that] every one who finds me will slay me."
3160,dby,"And Jehovah said to him, Therefore, whoever slayeth Cain, it shall be revenged sevenfold. And Jehovah set a mark on Cain, lest any finding him should smite him."
3161,dby,"And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, toward the east of Eden."
3162,dby,"And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city; and he called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch."
3163,dby,And to Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael; and Mehujael begot Methushael; and Methushael begot Lemech.
3164,dby,"And Lemech took two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the second, Zillah."
3165,dby,"And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of those who dwell in tents, and [breed] cattle."
3166,dby,And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of those who handle the harp and pipe.
3167,dby,"And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain, the forger of every kind of tool of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah."
3168,dby,"And Lemech said to his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice, Ye wives of Lemech, listen to my speech. For I have slain a man for my wound, and a youth for my bruise."
3169,dby,If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold; Lemech seventy and seven fold.
3170,dby,"And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Seth: ... For God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, because Cain has slain him."
3171,dby,"And to Seth, to him also was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah."
3172,dby,"This is the book of Adam's generations. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him."
3173,dby,"Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created."
3174,dby,"And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot [a son] in his likeness, after his image, and called his name Seth."
3175,dby,And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years; and he begot sons and daughters.
3176,dby,And all the days of Adam that he lived were nine hundred and thirty years; and he died.
3177,dby,"And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begot Enosh."
3178,dby,"And Seth lived after he had begotten Enosh eight hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters."
3179,dby,And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years; and he died.
3180,dby,"And Enosh lived ninety years, and begot Cainan."
3181,dby,"And Enosh lived after he had begotten Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begot sons and daughters."
3182,dby,And all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years; and he died.
3183,dby,"And Cainan lived seventy years, and begot Mahalaleel."
3184,dby,"And Cainan lived after he had begotten Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begot sons and daughters."
3185,dby,And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.
3186,dby,"And Mahalaleel lived sixty-five years, and begot Jared."
3187,dby,"And Mahalaleel lived after he had begotten Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters."
3188,dby,And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred and ninety-five years; and he died.
3189,dby,"And Jared lived a hundred and sixty-two years, and begot Enoch."
3190,dby,"And Jared lived after he had begotten Enoch eight hundred years, and begot sons and daughters."
3191,dby,And all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years; and he died.
3192,dby,"And Enoch lived sixty-five years, and begot Methushelah."
3193,dby,"And Enoch walked with God after he had begotten Methushelah three hundred years, and begot sons and daughters."
3194,dby,And all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.
3195,dby,"And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him."
3196,dby,"And Methushelah lived a hundred and eighty-seven years, and begot Lemech."
3197,dby,"And Methushelah lived after he had begotten Lemech seven hundred and eighty-two years, and begot sons and daughters."
3198,dby,And all the days of Methushelah were nine hundred and sixty-nine years; and he died.
3199,dby,"And Lemech lived a hundred and eighty-two years, and begot a son."
3200,dby,"And he called his name Noah, saying, This [one] shall comfort us concerning our work and concerning the toil of our hands, because of the ground which Jehovah has cursed."
3201,dby,"And Lemech lived after he had begotten Noah five hundred and ninety-five years, and begot sons and daughters."
3202,dby,And all the days of Lemech were seven hundred and seventy-seven years; and he died.
3203,dby,"And Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah begot Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
3204,dby,"And it came to pass when mankind began to multiply on the earth, and daughters were born to them,"
3205,dby,"that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair, and took themselves wives of all that they chose."
3206,dby,"And Jehovah said, My Spirit shall not always plead with Man; for he indeed is flesh; but his days shall be a hundred and twenty years."
3207,dby,"In those days were the giants on the earth, and also afterwards, when the sons of God had come in to the daughters of men, and they had borne [children] to them; these were the heroes, who of old were men of renown."
3208,dby,"And Jehovah saw that the wickedness of Man was great on the earth, and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart only evil continually."
3209,dby,"And Jehovah repented that he had made Man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart."
3210,dby,"And Jehovah said, I will destroy Man, whom I have created, from the earth -- from man to cattle, to creeping things, and to fowl of the heavens; for I repent that I have made them."
3211,dby,But Noah found favour in the eyes of Jehovah.
3212,dby,"This is the history of Noah. Noah was a just man, perfect amongst his generations: Noah walked with God."
3213,dby,"And Noah begot three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
3214,dby,"And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was full of violence."
3215,dby,"And God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted its way on the earth."
3216,dby,"And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me, for the earth is full of violence through them; and behold, I will destroy them with the earth."
3217,dby,Make thyself an ark of gopher wood: [with] cells shalt thou make the ark; and pitch it inside and outside with pitch.
3218,dby,"And thus shalt thou make it: let the length of the ark be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits."
3219,dby,"A light shalt thou make to the ark; and to a cubit high shalt thou finish it above. And the door of the ark shalt thou set in its side: [with] a lower, second, and third [story] shalt thou make it."
3220,dby,"For I, behold, I bring a flood of waters on the earth, to destroy all flesh under the heavens in which is the breath of life: everything that is on the earth shall expire."
3221,dby,"But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt go into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee."
3222,dby,"And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every [sort] shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep [them] alive with thee: they shall be male and female."
3223,dby,"Of fowl after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of each shall go in to thee, to keep [them] alive."
3224,dby,"And take thou of all food that is eaten, and gather [it] to thee, that it may be for food for thee and for them."
3225,dby,"And Noah did it; according to all that God had commanded him, so did he."
3226,dby,"And Jehovah said to Noah, Go into the ark, thou and all thy house; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation."
3227,dby,"Of all clean beasts thou shalt take to thee by sevens, a male and its female; but of the beasts that are not clean two, a male and its female."
3228,dby,"Also of the fowl of the heavens by sevens, male and female; to keep seed alive on the face of all the earth."
3229,dby,For in yet seven days I will cause it to rain on the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living being which I have made will I destroy from the ground.
3230,dby,And Noah did according to all that Jehovah had commanded him.
3231,dby,And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was on the earth.
3232,dby,"And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood."
3233,dby,"Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowl, and of everything that creeps on the ground,"
3234,dby,"there came two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as God had commanded Noah."
3235,dby,And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were on the earth.
3236,dby,"In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that same day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened."
3237,dby,And the pour of rain was on the earth forty days and forty nights.
3238,dby,"On the same day went Noah, and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;"
3239,dby,"they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and all fowl after its kind -- every bird of every wing."
3240,dby,"And they went to Noah, into the ark, two and two of all flesh, in which was the breath of life."
3241,dby,"And they that came, came male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him. And Jehovah shut him in."
3242,dby,"And the flood was forty days on the earth. And the waters increased, and bore up the ark; and it was lifted up above the earth."
3243,dby,And the waters prevailed and increased greatly on the earth; and the ark went on the face of the waters.
3244,dby,And the waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth; and all the high mountains that are under all the heavens were covered.
3245,dby,Fifteen cubits upward the waters prevailed; and the mountains were covered.
3246,dby,"And all flesh that moved on the earth expired, fowl as well as cattle, and beasts, and all crawling things which crawl on the earth, and all mankind:"
3247,dby,"everything which had in its nostrils the breath of life, of all that was on the dry [land], died."
3248,dby,"And every living being was destroyed that was on the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping things, and fowl of the heavens; and they were destroyed from the earth. And Noah alone remained, and what was with him in the ark."
3249,dby,And the waters prevailed on the earth a hundred and fifty days.
3250,dby,"And God remembered Noah, and all the animals, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark; and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided."
3251,dby,"And the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were closed, and the pour of rain from heaven was stopped."
3252,dby,"And the waters retired from the earth, continually retiring; and in the course of a hundred and fifty days the waters abated."
3253,dby,"And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat."
3254,dby,"And the waters abated continually until the tenth month: in the tenth [month], on the first of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen."
3255,dby,And it came to pass at the end of forty days that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made.
3256,dby,"And he sent out the raven, which went forth going to and fro, until the waters were dried from the earth."
3257,dby,"And he sent out the dove from him, to see if the waters had become low on the ground."
3258,dby,"But the dove found no resting-place for the sole of her foot, and returned to him into the ark; for the waters were on the whole earth; and he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her to him into the ark."
3259,dby,"And he waited yet other seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark."
3260,dby,"And the dove came to him at eventide; and behold, in her beak was an olive-leaf plucked off; and Noah knew that the waters had become low on the earth."
3261,dby,"And he waited yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; but she returned no more to him."
3262,dby,"And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first [month], on the first of the month, that the waters were dried up from the earth. And Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the surface of the ground was dried."
3263,dby,"And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry."
3264,dby,"And God spoke to Noah, saying,"
3265,dby,"Go out of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee."
3266,dby,"Bring forth with thee every animal which is with thee, of all flesh, fowl as well as cattle, and all the creeping things which creep on the earth, that they may swarm on the earth, and may be fruitful and multiply on the earth."
3267,dby,"And Noah went out, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him."
3268,dby,"All the animals, all the creeping things, and all the fowl -- everything that moves on the earth, after their kinds, went out of the ark."
3269,dby,"And Noah built an altar to Jehovah; and took of every clean animal, and of all clean fowl, and offered up burnt-offerings on the altar."
3270,dby,"And Jehovah smelled the sweet odour. And Jehovah said in his heart, I will no more henceforth curse the ground on account of Man, for the thought of Man's heart is evil from his youth; and I will no more smite every living thing, as I have done."
3271,dby,"Henceforth, all the days of the earth, seed [time] and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease."
3272,dby,"And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth."
3273,dby,"And let the fear of you and the dread of you be upon every animal of the earth, and upon all fowl of the heavens: upon all that moveth [on] the ground; and upon all the fishes of the sea: into your hand are they delivered."
3274,dby,Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you: as the green herb I give you everything.
3275,dby,"Only, the flesh with its life, its blood, ye shall not eat."
3276,dby,"And indeed your blood, [the blood] of your lives, will I require: at the hand of every animal will I require it, and at the hand of Man, at the hand of each [the blood] of his brother, will I require the life of Man."
3277,dby,"Whoso sheddeth Man's blood, by Man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God he hath made Man."
3278,dby,"And ye, be fruitful and multiply: swarm on the earth, and multiply on it."
3279,dby,"And God spoke to Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,"
3280,dby,"And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;"
3281,dby,"and with every living soul which is with you, fowl as well as cattle, and all the animals of the earth with you, of all that has gone out of the ark -- every animal of the earth."
3282,dby,"And I establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood, and henceforth there shall be no flood to destroy the earth."
3283,dby,"And God said, This is the sign of the covenant that I set between me and you and every living soul that is with you, for everlasting generations:"
3284,dby,"I set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be for a sign of the covenant between me and the earth."
3285,dby,"And it shall come to pass when I bring clouds over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud,"
3286,dby,and I will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living soul of all flesh; and the waters shall not henceforth become a flood to destroy all flesh.
3287,dby,"And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living soul of all flesh that is upon the earth."
3288,dby,"And God said to Noah, This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth."
3289,dby,"And the sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth. And Ham is the father of Canaan."
3290,dby,These three are the sons of Noah; and from these was [the population of] the whole earth spread abroad.
3291,dby,"And Noah began [to be] a husbandman, and planted a vineyard."
3292,dby,"And he drank of the wine, and was drunken, and he uncovered himself in his tent."
3293,dby,"And Ham the father of Canaan saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren outside."
3294,dby,"And Shem and Japheth took the upper garment and both laid [it] upon their shoulders, and went backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father. And their faces were turned away, that they saw not their father's nakedness."
3295,dby,"And Noah awoke from his wine, and learned what his youngest son had done to him."
3296,dby,"And he said, Cursed be Canaan; Let him be a bondman of bondmen to his brethren."
3297,dby,"And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem, And let Canaan be his bondman."
3298,dby,"Let God enlarge Japheth, and let him dwell in the tents of Shem, And let Canaan be his bondman."
3299,dby,And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
3300,dby,And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died.
3301,dby,"And these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and to them were sons born after the flood."
3302,dby,"The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras."
3303,dby,"And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah."
3304,dby,"And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim."
3305,dby,"From these came the distribution of the isles of the nations, according to their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations."
3306,dby,"And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan."
3307,dby,"And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha. And the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan."
3308,dby,And Cush begot Nimrod: he began to be mighty on the earth.
3309,dby,"He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah; therefore it is said, As Nimrod, the mighty hunter before Jehovah!"
3310,dby,"And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar."
3311,dby,"From that land went out Asshur, and built Nineveh, and Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah,"
3312,dby,"and Resen, between Nineveh and Calah: this is the great city."
3313,dby,"-- And Mizraim begot the Ludim, and the Anamim, and the Lehabim, and the Naphtuhim,"
3314,dby,"and the Pathrusim, and the Casluhim, out of whom came the Philistines, and the Caphtorim."
3315,dby,"-- And Canaan begot Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth,"
3316,dby,"and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,"
3317,dby,"and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,"
3318,dby,"and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. And afterwards the families of the Canaanites spread themselves abroad."
3319,dby,"And the border of the Canaanite was from Sidon, as one goes to Gerar, up to Gazah; as one goes to Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, up to Lesha."
3320,dby,"These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations."
3321,dby,"And to Shem -- to him also were [sons] born; he is the father of all the sons of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder."
3322,dby,"The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram."
3323,dby,"And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash."
3324,dby,-- And Arphaxad begot Shelah; and Shelah begot Eber.
3325,dby,"And to Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg, for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan."
3326,dby,"And Joktan begot Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,"
3327,dby,"and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,"
3328,dby,"and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,"
3329,dby,"and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were sons of Joktan."
3330,dby,"And their dwelling was from Mesha, as one goes to Sephar, the eastern mountain."
3331,dby,"These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations."
3332,dby,"These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations. And from these came the distribution of the nations on the earth after the flood."
3333,dby,"And the whole earth had one language, and the same words."
3334,dby,"And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and dwelt there."
3335,dby,"And they said one to another, Come on, let us make bricks, and burn [them] thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and they had asphalt for mortar."
3336,dby,"And they said, Come on, let us build ourselves a city and a tower, the top of which [may reach] to the heavens; and let us make ourselves a name, lest we be scattered over the face of the whole earth."
3337,dby,And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men built.
3338,dby,"And Jehovah said, Behold, the people is one, and have all one language; and this have they begun to do. And now will they be hindered in nothing that they meditate doing."
3339,dby,"Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech."
3340,dby,And Jehovah scattered them thence over the face of the whole earth. And they left off building the city.
3341,dby,Therefore was its name called Babel; because Jehovah there confounded the language of the whole earth. And Jehovah scattered them thence over the face of the whole earth.
3342,dby,"These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begot Arphaxad two years after the flood."
3343,dby,"And Shem lived after he had begotten Arphaxad five hundred years, and begot sons and daughters."
3344,dby,"And Arphaxad lived thirty-five years, and begot Shelah."
3345,dby,"And Arphaxad lived after he had begotten Shelah four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters."
3346,dby,"And Shelah lived thirty years, and begot Eber."
3347,dby,"And Shelah lived after he had begotten Eber four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters."
3348,dby,"And Eber lived thirty-four years, and begot Peleg."
3349,dby,"And Eber lived after he had begotten Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters."
3350,dby,"And Peleg lived thirty years, and begot Reu."
3351,dby,"And Peleg lived after he had begotten Reu two hundred and nine years, and begot sons and daughters."
3352,dby,"And Reu lived thirty-two years, and begot Serug."
3353,dby,"And Reu lived after he had begotten Serug two hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters."
3354,dby,"And Serug lived thirty years, and begot Nahor."
3355,dby,"And Serug lived after he had begotten Nahor two hundred years, and begot sons and daughters."
3356,dby,"And Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and begot Terah."
3357,dby,"And Nahor lived after he had begotten Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begot sons and daughters."
3358,dby,"And Terah lived seventy years, and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran."
3359,dby,"And these are the generations of Terah: Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begot Lot."
3360,dby,And Haran died before the face of his father Terah in the land of his nativity at Ur of the Chaldeans.
3361,dby,"And Abram and Nahor took wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, a daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah."
3362,dby,And Sarai was barren: she had no child.
3363,dby,"And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth together out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan, and came as far as Haran, and dwelt there."
3364,dby,And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran.
3365,dby,"And Jehovah had said to Abram, Go out of thy land, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, to the land that I will shew thee."
3366,dby,"And I will make of thee a great nation, and bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing."
3367,dby,"And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee; and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed."
3368,dby,And Abram departed as Jehovah had said to him. And Lot went with him. And Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed out of Haran.
3369,dby,"And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their possessions that they had acquired, and the souls that they had obtained in Haran, and they went out to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came."
3370,dby,"And Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land."
3371,dby,"And Jehovah appeared to Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land. And there he built an altar to Jehovah who had appeared to him."
3372,dby,"And he removed thence towards the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, [having] Bethel toward the west, and Ai toward the east; and there he built an altar to Jehovah, and called on the name of Jehovah."
3373,dby,"And Abram moved onward, going on still toward the south."
3374,dby,"And there was a famine in the land. And Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was grievous in the land."
3375,dby,"And it came to pass when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a woman fair to look upon."
3376,dby,"And it will come to pass when the Egyptians see thee, that they will say, She is his wife; and they will slay me, and save thee alive."
3377,dby,"Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister, that it may be well with me on thy account, and my soul may live because of thee."
3378,dby,"And it came to pass when Abram came into Egypt, that the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair."
3379,dby,"And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house."
3380,dby,"And he treated Abram well on her account; and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and bondmen, and bondwomen, and she-asses, and camels."
3381,dby,And Jehovah plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.
3382,dby,"And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this thou hast done to me? Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?"
3383,dby,"Why didst thou say, She is my sister, so that I took her as my wife. And now, behold, there is thy wife: take [her], and go away."
3384,dby,"And Pharaoh commanded [his] men concerning him, and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had."
3385,dby,"And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, towards the south."
3386,dby,"And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold."
3387,dby,"And he went on his journeys from the south as far as Bethel; as far as the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai;"
3388,dby,to the place of the altar that he had made there at the first. And there Abram called on the name of Jehovah.
3389,dby,"And Lot also who went with Abram had flocks, and herds, and tents."
3390,dby,"And the land could not support them, that they might dwell together, for their property was great; and they could not dwell together."
3391,dby,And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle. And the Canaanite and the Perizzite were dwelling then in the land.
3392,dby,"And Abram said to Lot, I pray thee let there be no contention between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen, for we are brethren."
3393,dby,"Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if to the left, then I will take the right; and if to the right, then I will take the left."
3394,dby,"And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of the Jordan that it was thoroughly watered, before Jehovah had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah; as the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, as one goes to Zoar."
3395,dby,And Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Jordan; and Lot went toward the east. And they separated the one from the other:
3396,dby,"Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan; and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain, and pitched tents as far as Sodom."
3397,dby,"And the people of Sodom were wicked, and great sinners before Jehovah."
3398,dby,"And Jehovah said to Abram, after that Lot had separated himself from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward and southward and eastward and westward;"
3399,dby,"for all the land that thou seest will I give to thee, and to thy seed for ever."
3400,dby,"And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth, so that if any one can number the dust of the earth, thy seed also will be numbered."
3401,dby,"Arise, walk through the land according to the length of it and according to the breadth of it; for I will give it to thee."
3402,dby,"Then Abram moved [his] tents, and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron. And he built there an altar to Jehovah."
3403,dby,"And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel the king of Shinar, Arioch the king of El-lasar, Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and Tidal the king of nations,"
3404,dby,"[that] they made war with Bera the king of Sodom, and with Birsha the king of Gomorrah, Shinab the king of Admah, and Shemeber the king of Zeboim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar."
3405,dby,"All these were joined in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea."
3406,dby,Twelve years had they served Chedorlaomer; and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
3407,dby,"And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-Kirjathaim,"
3408,dby,"and the Horites on their mount Seir, to El-Paran, which is by the wilderness."
3409,dby,"And they returned, and came to En-mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites that dwelt at Hazazon-Tamar."
3410,dby,"And the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar, went out, and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim,"
3411,dby,"with Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and Tidal the king of nations, and Amraphel the king of Shinar, and Arioch the king of Ellasar -- four kings with the five."
3412,dby,"And the vale of Siddim was full of pits of asphalt. And the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there: and they that remained fled to the mountain."
3413,dby,"And they took all the property of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and departed."
3414,dby,"And they took Lot and his property, Abram's brother's son, and departed. For he dwelt in Sodom."
3415,dby,"And one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew. And he dwelt by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, the brother of Eshcol, and the brother of Aner. And these were Abram's allies."
3416,dby,"And Abram heard that his brother was taken captive; and he led out his trained [servants], born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued [them] as far as Dan."
3417,dby,"And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them as far as Hobah, which is to the left of Damascus."
3418,dby,"And he brought back all the property, and brought again his brother Lot and his property, and the women also, and the people."
3419,dby,"And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after he had returned from smiting Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, into the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's valley."
3420,dby,And Melchisedec king of Salem brought out bread and wine. And he was priest of the Most High ÌÄå_God.
3421,dby,"And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the Most High ÌÄå_God, possessor of heavens and earth."
3422,dby,"And blessed be the Most High ÌÄå_God, who has delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him the tenth of all."
3423,dby,"And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the souls, and take the property for thyself."
3424,dby,"And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand to Jehovah, the Most High ÌÄå_God, possessor of heavens and earth,"
3425,dby,"if from a thread even to a sandal-thong, yes, if of all that is thine, I take [anything] ...; that thou mayest not say, I have made Abram rich;"
3426,dby,"save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men that went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, let them take their portion."
3427,dby,"After these things the word of Jehovah came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram; I am thy shield, thy exceeding great reward."
3428,dby,"And Abram said, Lord Jehovah, what wilt thou give me? seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus."
3429,dby,"And Abram said, Lo, to me thou hast given no seed, and behold, a son of my house will be mine heir."
3430,dby,"And behold, the word of Jehovah [came] to him, saying, This shall not be thine heir, but he that will come forth out of thy body shall be thine heir."
3431,dby,"And he led him out, and said, Look now toward the heavens, and number the stars, if thou be able to number them. And he said to him, So shall thy seed be!"
3432,dby,And he believed Jehovah; and he reckoned it to him [as] righteousness.
3433,dby,"And he said to him, I am Jehovah who brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to possess it."
3434,dby,"And he said, Lord Jehovah, how shall I know that I shall possess it?"
3435,dby,"And he said to him, Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon."
3436,dby,"And he took all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid the half of each opposite its fellow; but the birds he did not divide."
3437,dby,And the birds of prey came down on the carcases; and Abram scared them away.
3438,dby,"And as the sun was just going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold, a horror, a great darkness, fell upon him."
3439,dby,"And he said to Abram, Know assuredly that thy seed will be a sojourner in a land [that is] not theirs, and they shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years."
3440,dby,But also that nation which they shall serve I will judge; and afterwards they shall come out with great property.
3441,dby,And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
3442,dby,And [in the] fourth generation they shall come hither again; for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
3443,dby,"And it came to pass when the sun had gone down, and it was dark, that behold, there was a smoking furnace, and a flame of fire which passed between those pieces."
3444,dby,"On the same day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates;"
3445,dby,"the Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,"
3446,dby,"and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaim,"
3447,dby,"and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."
3448,dby,And Sarai Abram's wife did not bear him [children]. And she had an Egyptian maidservant; and her name was Hagar.
3449,dby,"And Sarai said to Abram, Behold now, Jehovah has shut me up, that I do not bear. Go in, I pray thee, to my maidservant: it may be that I shall be built up by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai."
3450,dby,"And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar, the Egyptian, her maidservant, at the end of ten years that Abram had dwelt in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram, as his wife."
3451,dby,"And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was lightly esteemed in her eyes."
3452,dby,"And Sarai said to Abram, My wrong be on thee! I have given my maidservant into thy bosom; and now she sees that she has conceived, I am lightly esteemed in her eyes. Jehovah judge between me and thee!"
3453,dby,"And Abram said to Sarai, Behold, thy maidservant is in thy hand: do to her what is good in thine eyes. And Sarai oppressed her; and she fled from her face."
3454,dby,"And the Angel of Jehovah found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur."
3455,dby,"And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maidservant, whence comest thou? and whither art thou going? And she said, I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai."
3456,dby,"And the Angel of Jehovah said to her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands."
3457,dby,"And the Angel of Jehovah said to her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude."
3458,dby,"And the Angel of Jehovah said to her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael, because Jehovah hath hearkened to thy affliction."
3459,dby,"And he will be a wild-ass of a man, his hand against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell before the face of all his brethren."
3460,dby,"And she called the name of Jehovah who spoke to her, Thou art the ÌÄå_God who reveals himself, for she said, Also here have I seen after he has revealed himself."
3461,dby,"Therefore the well was named Beer-lahai-roi: behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered."
3462,dby,"And Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called the name of his son whom Hagar bore, Ishmael."
3463,dby,And Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
3464,dby,"And Abram was ninety-nine years old, when Jehovah appeared to Abram, and said to him, I [am] the Almighty ÌÄå_God: walk before my face, and be perfect."
3465,dby,"And I will set my covenant between me and thee, and will very greatly multiply thee."
3466,dby,"And Abram fell on his face; and God talked with him, saying,"
3467,dby,"It is I: behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of a multitude of nations."
3468,dby,"And thy name shall no more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of a multitude of nations have I made thee."
3469,dby,"And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee."
3470,dby,"And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee."
3471,dby,"And I give to thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojourning, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be a God to them."
3472,dby,"And God said to Abraham, And [as for] thee, thou shalt keep my covenant, thou and thy seed after thee in their generations."
3473,dby,"This is my covenant which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee -- that every male among you be circumcised."
3474,dby,And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and [that] shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you.
3475,dby,"And at eight days old shall every male in your generations be circumcised among you -- he who is born in the house, and he who is bought with money, any stranger who is not of thy seed."
3476,dby,"He who is born in thy house, and he who is bought with thy money, must be circumcised; and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant."
3477,dby,"And the uncircumcised male who hath not been circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his peoples: he hath broken my covenant."
3478,dby,"And God said to Abraham, [As to] Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name."
3479,dby,"And I will bless her, and I will give thee a son also of her; and I will bless her, and she shall become nations: kings of peoples shall be of her."
3480,dby,"And Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall [a child] be born to him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear?"
3481,dby,"And Abraham said to God, Oh that Ishmael might live before thee!"
3482,dby,"And God said, Sarah thy wife shall indeed bear thee a son; and thou shalt call his name Isaac; and I will establish my covenant with him, for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him."
3483,dby,"And for Ishmael I have heard thee: behold, I will bless him, and will make him fruitful, and will very greatly multiply him; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation."
3484,dby,"But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to thee at this appointed time in the next year."
3485,dby,And he left off talking with him; and God went up from Abraham.
3486,dby,"And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all who were born in his house, and all who were bought with his money -- every male among the people of Abraham's house -- and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on that same day, as God had said to him."
3487,dby,And Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
3488,dby,And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
3489,dby,"In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son;"
3490,dby,"and all the men of his house, born in his house, or bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him."
3491,dby,And Jehovah appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre. And he sat at the tent-door in the heat of the day.
3492,dby,"And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, three men standing near him. And when he saw [them], he ran to meet them from the tent-door, and bowed himself to the earth,"
3493,dby,"and said, Lord, if now I have found favour in thine eyes, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant."
3494,dby,"Let now a little water be fetched, that ye may wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree."
3495,dby,"And I will fetch a morsel of bread; and refresh yourselves; after that ye shall pass on; for therefore have ye passed on towards your servant. And they said, So do as thou hast said."
3496,dby,"And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, Knead quickly three seahs of wheaten flour, and make cakes."
3497,dby,"And Abraham ran to the herd, and took a calf tender and good, and gave [it] to the attendant; and he hasted to dress it."
3498,dby,"And he took thick and sweet milk, and the calf that he had dressed, and set [it] before them; and he stood before them under the tree, and they ate."
3499,dby,"And they said to him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent."
3500,dby,"And he said, I will certainly return to thee at [this] time of the year, and behold, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah was listening at the tent-door, which was behind him."
3501,dby,Now Abraham and Sarah were old [and] advanced in age: it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
3502,dby,"And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am become old, shall I have pleasure, and my lord old?"
3503,dby,"And Jehovah said to Abraham, Why is this, that Sarah laughs, saying, Shall I indeed bear, when I am become old?"
3504,dby,"Is [any] matter too wonderful for Jehovah? At the time appointed I will return to thee, at [this] time of the year, and Sarah shall have a son."
3505,dby,"And Sarah denied, saying, I did not laugh; for she was afraid. And he said, No; but thou didst laugh."
3506,dby,"And the men rose up thence, and looked toward Sodom; and Abraham went with them to conduct them."
3507,dby,"And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing?"
3508,dby,Since Abraham shall indeed become a great and mighty nation; and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him.
3509,dby,"For I know him that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice, in order that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham what he hath spoken of him."
3510,dby,"And Jehovah said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grievous,"
3511,dby,"I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come to me; and if not, I will know [it]."
3512,dby,"And the men turned thence, and went towards Sodom; and Abraham remained yet standing before Jehovah."
3513,dby,"And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also cause the righteous to perish with the wicked?"
3514,dby,There are perhaps fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not forgive the place for the sake of the fifty righteous that are therein?
3515,dby,"Far be it from thee to do so, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that the righteous should be as the wicked -- far be it from thee! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?"
3516,dby,"And Jehovah said, If I find at Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will forgive all the place for their sakes."
3517,dby,"And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have ventured to speak unto the Lord; I, who am dust and ashes."
3518,dby,"Perhaps there may want five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city on account of the five? And he said, If I shall find forty-five there, I will not destroy [it]."
3519,dby,"And he continued yet to speak with him, and said, Perhaps there may be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty's sake."
3520,dby,"And he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry that I speak! Perhaps there may be thirty found there. And he said, I will not do it if I find thirty there."
3521,dby,"And he said, Behold now, I have ventured to speak with the Lord. Perhaps there may be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for the twenty's sake."
3522,dby,"And he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, that I speak yet but this time! Perhaps there may be ten found there. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for the ten's sake."
3523,dby,And Jehovah went away when he had ended speaking to Abraham; and Abraham returned to his place.
3524,dby,"And the two angels came to Sodom at even. And Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. And Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them; and he bowed down, the face toward the ground,"
3525,dby,"and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and lodge, and wash your feet; and ye shall rise up early, and go on your way. And they said, No; but we will pass the night in the open place."
3526,dby,"And he urged them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house. And he made them a repast, and baked unleavened cakes; and they ate."
3527,dby,"Before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, from the youngest to the oldest -- all the people from every quarter."
3528,dby,"And they called to Lot, and said to him, Where are the men that have come in to thee to-night? bring them out to us that we may know them."
3529,dby,"And Lot went out to them to the entrance, and shut the door after him,"
3530,dby,"and said, I pray you, my brethren, do not wickedly!"
3531,dby,"Behold now, I have two daughters who have not known a man: let me now bring them out to you; and do to them as is good in your sight: only, to these men do nothing; for therefore have they come under the shadow of my roof."
3532,dby,"And they said, Back there! And they said [again], This one came to sojourn, and he must be a judge? Now we will deal worse with thee than with them. And they pressed hard on the man -- on Lot; and drew near to break the door."
3533,dby,"And the men stretched out their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door."
3534,dby,"And they smote the men that were at the entrance of the house with blindness, from the smallest to the greatest; and they wearied themselves to find the entrance."
3535,dby,"And the men said to Lot, Whom hast thou here besides? a son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and all whom thou hast in the city -- bring [them] out of the place."
3536,dby,"For we are going to destroy this place, because the cry of them is great before Jehovah, and Jehovah has sent us to destroy it."
3537,dby,"And Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who had married his daughters, and said, Up, go out of this place, for Jehovah will destroy the city. But he was as if he jested, in the sight of his sons-in-law."
3538,dby,"And as the dawn arose, the angels urged Lot, saying, Up, take thy wife and thy two daughters who are present, lest thou perish in the iniquity of the city."
3539,dby,"And as he lingered, the men laid hold on his hand, and on the hand of his wife, and on the hand of his two daughters, Jehovah being merciful to him; and they led him out, and set him without the city."
3540,dby,"And it came to pass when they had brought them outside, that he said, Escape for thy life: look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain: escape to the mountain, lest thou perish."
3541,dby,"And Lot said to them, Not [so], I pray thee, Lord;"
3542,dby,"behold now, thy servant has found favour in thine eyes, and thou hast magnified thy goodness, which thou hast shewn to me in preserving my soul alive; but I cannot escape to the mountain, lest calamity lay hold on me, that I die."
3543,dby,"Behold now, this city is near to flee to, and it is small: I pray thee, let me escape thither -- is it not small? -- and my soul shall live."
3544,dby,"And he said to him, Behold, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken."
3545,dby,"Haste, escape thither; for I cannot do anything until thou art come there. Therefore the name of the city is called Zoar."
3546,dby,The sun rose upon the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
3547,dby,"And Jehovah rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven,"
3548,dby,"and overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew upon the ground."
3549,dby,"And his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt."
3550,dby,And Abraham rose early in the morning [and went] to the place where he had stood before Jehovah;
3551,dby,"and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and lo, a smoke went up from the land as the smoke of a furnace."
3552,dby,"And it came to pass when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt."
3553,dby,"And Lot went up from Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar. And he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters."
3554,dby,"And the first-born said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the land to come in to us after the manner of all the earth:"
3555,dby,"come, let us give our father wine to drink, and let us lie with him, that we may preserve seed alive of our father."
3556,dby,"And they gave their father wine to drink that night. And the first-born went in, and lay with her father, and he did not know of her lying down, nor of her rising."
3557,dby,"And it came to pass on the next day that the first-born said to the younger, Lo, I lay last night with my father: let us give him wine to drink to-night also, and go thou in, lie with him, that we may preserve seed alive of our father."
3558,dby,"And they gave their father wine to drink that night also. And the younger arose, and lay with him; and he did not know of her lying down, nor of her rising."
3559,dby,And both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father.
3560,dby,"And the first-born bore a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites to this day."
3561,dby,"And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi; the same is the father of the children of Ammon to this day."
3562,dby,"And Abraham departed thence towards the south country, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned at Gerar."
3563,dby,"And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister. And Abimelech the king of Gerar sent and took Sarah."
3564,dby,"But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art [but] a dead man, because of the woman that thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife."
3565,dby,"But Abimelech had not come near her. And he said, Lord, wilt thou also kill a righteous nation?"
3566,dby,"Did he not say to me, She is my sister? and she, even she said, He is my brother. In the integrity of my heart and in the innocency of my hands have I done this."
3567,dby,"And God said to him in a dream, I also knew that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart, and I, too, have withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore have I not suffered thee to touch her."
3568,dby,"And now, restore the man's wife; for he is a prophet, and will pray for thee, that thou mayest live. And if thou do not restore [her], know that thou shalt certainly die, thou and all that is thine."
3569,dby,"And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and spoke all these words in their ears; and the men were greatly afraid."
3570,dby,"And Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, What hast thou done to us? And in what have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought on me, and on my kingdom, a great sin? Thou hast done to me deeds that ought not to be done."
3571,dby,"And Abimelech said to Abraham, What hast thou seen that thou hast done this?"
3572,dby,"And Abraham said, Because I said, Surely the fear of God is not in this place, and they will kill me for my wife's sake."
3573,dby,"But she is also truly my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife."
3574,dby,"And it came to pass when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, Let this be thy kindness which thou shalt shew to me: at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother."
3575,dby,"And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and bondmen and bondwomen, and gave [them] to Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife."
3576,dby,"And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it is good in thine eyes."
3577,dby,"And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand [pieces] of silver; behold, let that be to thee a covering of the eyes, in respect of all that are with thee, and with all; and she was reproved."
3578,dby,"And Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and his wife and his handmaids, and they bore [children]."
3579,dby,For Jehovah had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah Abraham's wife.
3580,dby,"And Jehovah visited Sarah as he had said, and Jehovah did to Sarah as he had spoken."
3581,dby,"And Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him."
3582,dby,"And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac."
3583,dby,"And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, being eight days old, as God had commanded him."
3584,dby,And Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
3585,dby,"And Sarah said, God has made me laugh: all that hear will laugh with me."
3586,dby,"And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, Sarah will suckle children? For I have borne [him] a son in his old age."
3587,dby,"And the child grew, and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned."
3588,dby,"And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking."
3589,dby,"And she said to Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her son; for the son of this handmaid shall not inherit with my son -- with Isaac."
3590,dby,And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.
3591,dby,"And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy handmaid: [in] all that Sarah hath said to thee hearken to her voice, for in Isaac shall a seed be called to thee."
3592,dby,"But also the son of the handmaid will I make a nation, because he is thy seed."
3593,dby,"And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a flask of water, and gave [it] to Hagar, putting [it] on her shoulder -- and the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered about in the wilderness of Beer-sheba."
3594,dby,"And the water was exhausted from the flask; and she cast the child under one of the shrubs,"
3595,dby,"and she went and sat down over against [him], a bow-shot off; for she said, Let me not behold the death of the child. And she sat over against [him], and lifted up her voice and wept."
3596,dby,"And God heard the voice of the lad. And the Angel of God called to Hagar from the heavens, and said to her, What [aileth] thee, Hagar? Fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad there, where he is."
3597,dby,"Arise, take the lad, and hold him in thy hand; for I will make of him a great nation."
3598,dby,"And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the flask with water, and gave the lad drink."
3599,dby,"And God was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer."
3600,dby,And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
3601,dby,"And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech, and Phichol the captain of his host, spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest."
3602,dby,"And now swear to me here by God that thou wilt not deal deceitfully with me, nor with my son, nor with my grandson. According to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land in which thou sojournest."
3603,dby,"And Abraham said, I will swear."
3604,dby,And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water that Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.
3605,dby,"And Abimelech said, I do not know who has done this, neither hast thou told me [of it], neither have I heard [of it] but to-day."
3606,dby,"And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant."
3607,dby,And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves.
3608,dby,"And Abimelech said to Abraham, What [mean] these seven ewe-lambs, these which thou hast set by themselves?"
3609,dby,"And he said, That thou take the seven ewe-lambs of my hand, that they may be a witness to me that I have dug this well."
3610,dby,"Therefore he called that place Beer-sheba, because there they had sworn, both of them."
3611,dby,"And they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. And Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the captain of his host, and returned into the land of the Philistines."
3612,dby,"And [Abraham] planted a tamarisk in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of Jehovah, the Eternal ÌÄå_God."
3613,dby,And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.
3614,dby,"And it came to pass after these things, that God tried Abraham, and said to him, Abraham! and he said, Here am I."
3615,dby,"And he said, Take now thy son, thine only [son], whom thou lovest, Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and there offer him up for a burnt-offering on one of the mountains which I will tell thee of."
3616,dby,"And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up and went to the place that God had told him of."
3617,dby,On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar.
3618,dby,"And Abraham said to his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you."
3619,dby,"And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and the knife, and they went both of them together."
3620,dby,"And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father! And he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the sheep for a burnt-offering?"
3621,dby,"And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself with the sheep for a burnt-offering. And they went both of them together."
3622,dby,"And they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built the altar there, and piled the wood; and he bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood."
3623,dby,"And Abraham stretched out his hand, and took the knife to slaughter his son."
3624,dby,"And the Angel of Jehovah called to him from the heavens, and said, Abraham, Abraham! And he said, Here am I."
3625,dby,"And he said, Stretch not out thy hand against the lad, neither do anything to him; for now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only [son], from me."
3626,dby,"And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind was a ram caught in the thicket by its horns; and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up for a burnt-offering instead of his son."
3627,dby,"And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh; as it is said at the present day, On the mount of Jehovah will be provided."
3628,dby,"And the Angel of Jehovah called to Abraham from the heavens a second time,"
3629,dby,"and said, By myself I swear, saith Jehovah, that, because thou hast done this, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only [son],"
3630,dby,"I will richly bless thee, and greatly multiply thy seed, as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is on the sea-shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;"
3631,dby,"and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves, because thou hast hearkened to my voice."
3632,dby,"And Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba. And Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba."
3633,dby,"And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also has borne sons to thy brother Nahor:"
3634,dby,"Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,"
3635,dby,"and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
3636,dby,"(And Bethuel begot Rebecca.) These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother."
3637,dby,"And his concubine, named Reumah, she also bore Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maacah."
3638,dby,And the life of Sarah was a hundred and twenty-seven years: [these were] the years of the life of Sarah.
3639,dby,"And Sarah died in Kirjath-Arba: that is Hebron, in the land of Canaan. And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her."
3640,dby,"And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,"
3641,dby,"I am a stranger and a sojourner with you; give me a possession of a sepulchre with you, that I may bury my dead from before me."
3642,dby,"And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,"
3643,dby,"Hear us, my lord: thou art a prince of God among us: in the choicest of our sepulchres bury thy dead: none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre for burying thy dead."
3644,dby,"And Abraham rose up, and bowed down to the people of the land, to the sons of Heth,"
3645,dby,"and spoke to them, saying, If it be your will that I should bury my dead from before me, hear me, and entreat for me Ephron the son of Zohar,"
3646,dby,"that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which is his, which is at the end of his field; for the full money let him give it to me amongst you for a possession of a sepulchre."
3647,dby,"And Ephron was dwelling among the sons of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham, in the ears of the sons of Heth, [even] of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,"
3648,dby,"No, my lord: hear me. The field give I thee; and the cave that is in it, to thee I give it; before the eyes of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead."
3649,dby,And Abraham bowed down before the people of the land;
3650,dby,"and he spoke to Ephron, in the ears of the people of the land, saying, But if only thou wouldst listen to me, I give the money for the field: take [it] of me, and I will bury my dead there."
3651,dby,"And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,"
3652,dby,"My lord, hearken to me. A field of four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and thee? bury therefore thy dead."
3653,dby,"And Abraham hearkened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the money that he had named in the ears of the sons of Heth -- four hundred shekels of silver, current with the merchant."
3654,dby,"So the field of Ephron, which was at Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave that was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all its borders round about,"
3655,dby,"were assured to Abraham for a possession before the eyes of the sons of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city."
3656,dby,"And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field at Machpelah, opposite to Mamre: that is Hebron, in the land of Canaan."
3657,dby,And the field and the cave that was in it were assured to Abraham for a possession of a sepulchre by the sons of Heth.
3658,dby,"And Abraham was old, [and] advanced in age; and Jehovah had blessed Abraham in all things."
3659,dby,"And Abraham said to his servant, the eldest of his house, who ruled over all that he had, Put thy hand, I pray thee, under my thigh,"
3660,dby,"and I will make thee swear by Jehovah, the God of the heavens and the God of the earth, that thou take not a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am dwelling;"
3661,dby,"but thou shalt go to my land and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac."
3662,dby,"And the servant said to him, Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land: must I, then, bring thy son again in any case to the land from which thou hast removed?"
3663,dby,"And Abraham said to him, Beware that thou bring not my son thither again."
3664,dby,"Jehovah the God of the heavens, who took me out of my father's house, and out of the land of my nativity, and who has spoken to me, and who has sworn to me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land -- he will send his angel before thee, that thou mayest take a wife for my son thence."
3665,dby,"And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be quit of this my oath: only, bring not my son thither again."
3666,dby,"And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore unto him concerning that matter."
3667,dby,"And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; now all the treasure of his master was under his hand; and he arose and went to Aram-naharaim, to the city of Nahor."
3668,dby,"And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by a well of water, at the time of the evening, when the women came out to draw [water]."
3669,dby,"And he said, Jehovah, God of my master Abraham, meet me, I pray thee, [with thy blessing] this day, and deal kindly with my master Abraham."
3670,dby,"Behold, I stand [here] by the well of water, and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water."
3671,dby,"And let it come to pass, [that] the maiden to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink, and who will say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also, be she whom thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and hereby I shall know that thou hast dealt kindly with my master."
3672,dby,"And it came to pass before he had ended speaking, that behold, Rebecca came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother; and [she had] her pitcher upon her shoulder."
3673,dby,"And the maiden was very fair in countenance; a virgin, and no man had known her. And she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up."
3674,dby,"And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, sip a little water out of thy pitcher."
3675,dby,"And she said, Drink, my lord! And she hasted and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him to drink."
3676,dby,"And when she had given him enough to drink, she said, I will draw [water] for thy camels also, until they have drunk enough."
3677,dby,"And she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw [water]; and she drew for all his camels."
3678,dby,"And the man was astonished at her, remaining silent, to know whether Jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not."
3679,dby,"And it came to pass when the camels had drunk enough, that the man took a gold ring, of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands, ten [shekels] weight of gold,"
3680,dby,"and said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee. Is there room [in] thy father's house for us to lodge?"
3681,dby,"And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor."
3682,dby,"And she said to him, There is straw, and also much provender with us; also room to lodge."
3683,dby,"And the man stooped, and bowed down before Jehovah,"
3684,dby,"and said, Blessed be Jehovah, God of my master Abraham, who has not withdrawn his loving-kindness and his faithfulness from my master; I being in the way, Jehovah has led me to the house of my master's brethren."
3685,dby,And the maiden ran and told these things to her mother's house.
3686,dby,"And Rebecca had a brother, named Laban; and Laban ran out to the man, to the well."
3687,dby,"And it came to pass when he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister's hand, and when he heard the words of Rebecca his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man to me -- that he came to the man, and behold, he was standing by the camels, by the well."
3688,dby,"And he said, Come in, blessed of Jehovah! why standest thou outside? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels."
3689,dby,"And the man came into the house; and he ungirded the camels, and gave the camels straw and provender, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of the men who were with him."
3690,dby,"And there was set [meat] before him to eat; but he said, I will not eat until I have made known my business. And he said, Speak on."
3691,dby,"And he said, I am Abraham's servant."
3692,dby,"And Jehovah has blessed my master greatly, and he is become great; and he has given him sheep and cattle, and silver and gold, and bondmen and bondwomen, and camels and asses."
3693,dby,"And Sarah, my master's wife, bore a son to my master after she had grown old; and unto him has he given all that he has."
3694,dby,"And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanite, in whose land I am dwelling;"
3695,dby,"but thou shalt by all means go to my father's house and to my family, and take a wife for my son."
3696,dby,"And I said to my master, Perhaps the woman will not follow me?"
3697,dby,"And he said to me, Jehovah, before whom I have walked, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way, that thou mayest take a wife for my son of my family, and out of my father's house."
3698,dby,"Then shalt thou be quit of my oath, when thou shalt have come to my family. And if they give thee not [one], thou shalt be quit of my oath."
3699,dby,"And I came this day to the well, and said, Jehovah, God of my master Abraham, if now thou wilt prosper my way on which I go,"
3700,dby,"behold, I stand by the well of water, and let it come to pass that the damsel who cometh forth to draw [water], and to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water out of thy pitcher to drink,"
3701,dby,"and she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels -- that she should be the woman whom Jehovah hath appointed for my master's son."
3702,dby,"Before I ended speaking in my heart, behold, Rebecca came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder, and went down to the well, and drew [water]; and I said to her, Give me, I pray thee, to drink."
3703,dby,"And she hasted and let down her pitcher from her [shoulder], and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. And I drank; and she gave the camels drink also."
3704,dby,"And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him. And I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands."
3705,dby,"And I stooped, and bowed down before Jehovah; and I blessed Jehovah, God of my master Abraham, who has led me the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son."
3706,dby,"And now, if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me; and I will turn to the right hand or to the left."
3707,dby,"And Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceeds from Jehovah: we cannot speak to thee bad or good."
3708,dby,"Behold, Rebecca is before thee: take [her], and go away; and let her be wife of thy master's son, as Jehovah has said."
3709,dby,"And it came to pass, when Abraham's servant heard their words, that he bowed down to the earth before Jehovah."
3710,dby,"And the servant brought forth silver articles, and gold articles, and clothing, and he gave [them] to Rebecca; and he gave to her brother, and to her mother, precious things."
3711,dby,"And they ate and drank, he and the men that were with him, and lodged. And they rose up in the morning; and he said, Send me away to my master."
3712,dby,"And her brother and her mother said, Let the maiden abide with us [some] days, or [say] ten; after that she shall go."
3713,dby,"And he said to them, Do not hinder me, seeing Jehovah has prospered my way: send me away, and I will go to my master."
3714,dby,"And they said, Let us call the maiden and inquire at her mouth."
3715,dby,"And they called Rebecca and said to her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go."
3716,dby,"And they sent away Rebecca their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men."
3717,dby,"And they blessed Rebecca, and said to her, Thou art our sister; mayest thou become thousands of tens of thousands; and may thy seed possess the gate of their enemies!"
3718,dby,"And Rebecca arose, and her maids, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebecca, and went away."
3719,dby,And Isaac had just returned from Beer-lahai-roi; for he was dwelling in the south country.
3720,dby,"And Isaac had gone out to meditate in the fields toward the beginning of evening. And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, camels were coming."
3721,dby,"And Rebecca lifted up her eyes and saw Isaac, and she sprang off the camel."
3722,dby,"And she had said to the servant, Who is the man that is walking in the fields to meet us? And the servant said, That is my master! Then she took the veil, and covered herself."
3723,dby,And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
3724,dby,"And Isaac led her into his mother Sarah's tent; and he took Rebecca, and she became his wife, and he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after [the death of] his mother."
3725,dby,And Abraham took another wife named Keturah.
3726,dby,"And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah."
3727,dby,"And Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan; and the sons of Dedan were the Asshurim, and the Letushim, and the Leummim."
3728,dby,"And the sons of Midian were Ephah, and Epher, and Enoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were sons of Keturah."
3729,dby,And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.
3730,dby,"And to the sons of the concubines that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and, while he yet lived, sent them away from Isaac his son, eastward to the east country."
3731,dby,And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived: a hundred and seventy-five years.
3732,dby,"And Abraham expired and died in a good old age, old and full [of days]; and was gathered to his peoples."
3733,dby,"And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which was opposite to Mamre --"
3734,dby,"the field that Abraham had purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife."
3735,dby,"And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac dwelt at Beer-lahai-roi."
3736,dby,"And these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's bondwoman, bore to Abraham."
3737,dby,"And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael by their names according to their generations: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,"
3738,dby,"and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,"
3739,dby,"Hadad and Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedmah."
3740,dby,"These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, in their hamlets and their encampments -- twelve princes of their peoples."
3741,dby,"And these are the years of the life of Ishmael: a hundred and thirty-seven years; and he expired and died, and was gathered to his peoples."
3742,dby,"And they dwelt from Havilah to Shur, which is opposite to Egypt, as one goes towards Assyria. He settled before the face of all his brethren."
3743,dby,"And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham begot Isaac."
3744,dby,"And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebecca as wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian."
3745,dby,"And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren; and Jehovah was entreated of him, and Rebecca his wife conceived."
3746,dby,"And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If [it be] so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of Jehovah."
3747,dby,"And Jehovah said to her, Two nations are in thy womb, And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels; And one people shall be stronger than the other people, And the elder shall serve the younger."
3748,dby,"And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb."
3749,dby,And the first came out red -- all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.
3750,dby,And after that came his brother out; and his hand took hold of Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when they were born.
3751,dby,"And the boys grew, and Esau became a man skilled in hunting, a man of the field; and Jacob was a homely man, dwelling in tents."
3752,dby,"And Isaac loved Esau, because venison was to his taste; and Rebecca loved Jacob."
3753,dby,"And Jacob had cooked a dish; and Esau came from the field, and he was faint."
3754,dby,"And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with the red -- the red thing there, for I am faint. Therefore was his name called Edom."
3755,dby,"And Jacob said, Sell me now thy birthright."
3756,dby,"And Esau said, Behold, I am going to die, and of what use can the birthright be to me?"
3757,dby,"And Jacob said, Swear unto me now. And he swore unto him, and sold his birthright to Jacob."
3758,dby,"And Jacob gave Esau bread and the dish of lentils; and he ate and drank, and rose up and went away. Thus Esau despised the birthright."
3759,dby,"And there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine which had been in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech the king of the Philistines, to Gerar."
3760,dby,"And Jehovah appeared to him and said, Go not down to Egypt: dwell in the land that I shall tell thee of."
3761,dby,"Sojourn in this land; and I will be with thee and bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries; and I will perform the oath which I swore unto Abraham thy father."
3762,dby,"And I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and unto thy seed will I give all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves --"
3763,dby,"because that Abraham hearkened to my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
3764,dby,And Isaac dwelt at Gerar.
3765,dby,"And the men of the place asked about his wife. And he said, She is my sister; for he feared to say, my wife, [saying to himself,] Lest the men of the place slay me on account of Rebecca -- because she was fair in countenance."
3766,dby,"And it came to pass when he had been there some time, that Abimelech the king of the Philistines looked out of the window, and saw, and behold, Isaac was dallying with Rebecca his wife."
3767,dby,"Then Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, she is certainly thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? and Isaac said to him, Because I said, Lest I die on account of her."
3768,dby,"And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done to us? But a little and one of the people might have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldest have brought a trespass on us."
3769,dby,"And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He that touches this man or his wife shall certainly be put to death."
3770,dby,"And Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundredfold; and Jehovah blessed him."
3771,dby,"And the man became great, and he became continually greater, until he was very great."
3772,dby,"And he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great number of servants; and the Philistines envied him."
3773,dby,"And all the wells that his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines stopped them and filled them with earth."
3774,dby,"And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go from us; for thou art become much mightier than we."
3775,dby,"And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his camp in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there."
3776,dby,"And Isaac dug again the wells of water that they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, and that the Philistines had stopped after the death of Abraham; and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them."
3777,dby,"And Isaac's servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water."
3778,dby,"But the shepherds of Gerar strove with Isaac's shepherds, saying, The water is ours. And he called the name of the well Esek, because they had quarrelled with him."
3779,dby,"And they dug another well, and they strove for that also; and he called the name of it Sitnah."
3780,dby,"And he removed thence and dug another well; and they did not strive for that. And he called the name of it Rehoboth, and said, For now Jehovah has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land."
3781,dby,And he went up thence to Beer-sheba.
3782,dby,"And Jehovah appeared to him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake."
3783,dby,"And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of Jehovah. And he pitched his tent there; and there Isaac's servants dug a well."
3784,dby,"And Abimelech, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phichol the captain of his host, went to him from Gerar."
3785,dby,"And Isaac said to them, Why are ye come to me, seeing ye hate me, and have driven me away from you?"
3786,dby,"And they said, We saw certainly that Jehovah is with thee; and we said, Let there be then an oath between us -- between us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee,"
3787,dby,"that thou wilt do us no wrong, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done to thee nothing but good, and have let thee go in peace; thou art now blessed of Jehovah."
3788,dby,"And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank."
3789,dby,"And they rose early in the morning, and swore one to another; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace."
3790,dby,"And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well that they had dug, and said to him, We have found water."
3791,dby,And he called it Shebah; therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.
3792,dby,"And Esau was forty years old, when he took as wives Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basmath the daughter of Elon the Hittite."
3793,dby,And they were a grief of mind to Isaac and to Rebecca.
3794,dby,"And it came to pass when Isaac had become old, and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, that he called Esau his elder son, and said to him, My son! And he said to him, Here am I."
3795,dby,"And he said, Behold now, I am become old; I know not the day of my death."
3796,dby,"And now, I pray thee, take thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field and hunt me venison,"
3797,dby,"and prepare me a savoury dish such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat, in order that my soul may bless thee before I die."
3798,dby,"And Rebecca heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt venison, to bring it."
3799,dby,"And Rebecca spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak to Esau thy brother, saying,"
3800,dby,"Bring me venison, and prepare me a savoury dish, that I may eat, and bless thee before Jehovah, before my death."
3801,dby,"And now, my son, hearken to my voice in that which I command thee."
3802,dby,"Go, I pray thee, to the flock, and fetch me thence two good kids of the goats. And I will make of them a savoury dish for thy father, such as he loves."
3803,dby,"And thou shalt bring [it] to thy father, that he may eat, in order that he may bless thee before his death."
3804,dby,"And Jacob said to Rebecca his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man."
3805,dby,"My father perhaps will feel me, and I shall be in his sight as one who mocks [him], and I shall bring a curse on me, and not a blessing."
3806,dby,"And his mother said to him, On me [be] thy curse, my son! Only hearken to my voice, and go, fetch [them]."
3807,dby,"And he went, and fetched and brought [them] to his mother. And his mother prepared a savoury dish such as his father loved."
3808,dby,"And Rebecca took the clothes of her elder son Esau, the costly ones which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son;"
3809,dby,"and she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck;"
3810,dby,and she gave the savoury dishes and the bread that she had prepared into the hand of her son Jacob.
3811,dby,"And he came to his father, and said, My father! And he said, Here am I: who art thou, my son?"
3812,dby,"And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau, thy firstborn. I have done according as thou didst say to me. Arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, in order that thy soul may bless me."
3813,dby,"And Isaac said to his son, How is it that thou hast found [it] so quickly, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah thy God put [it] in my way."
3814,dby,"And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be really my son Esau or not."
3815,dby,"And Jacob drew near to Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
3816,dby,"And he did not discern him, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands; and he blessed him."
3817,dby,"And he said, Art thou really my son Esau? And he said, It is I."
3818,dby,"And he said, Bring [it] near to me, that I may eat of my son's venison, in order that my soul may bless thee. And he brought [it] near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank."
3819,dby,"And his father Isaac said to him, Come near, now, and kiss me, my son."
3820,dby,"And he came near, and kissed him. And he smelt the smell of his clothes, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Jehovah hath blessed."
3821,dby,"And God give thee of the dew of heaven, And of the fatness of the earth, And plenty of corn and new wine."
3822,dby,"Let peoples serve thee, And races bow down to thee. Be lord over thy brethren, And let thy mother's sons bow down to thee. Cursed be they that curse thee, And blessed be they that bless thee."
3823,dby,"And it came to pass when Isaac had ended blessing Jacob, and when Jacob was only just gone out from Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came from his hunting."
3824,dby,"And he also had prepared savoury dishes, and he brought [them] in to his father, and said to his father, Let my father arise and eat of his son's venison, in order that thy soul may bless me."
3825,dby,"And Isaac his father said to him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn, Esau."
3826,dby,"Then Isaac trembled with exceeding great trembling, and said, Who was he, then, that hunted venison and brought [it] to me? And I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him; also blessed he shall be."
3827,dby,"When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me -- me also, my father!"
3828,dby,"And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and has taken away thy blessing."
3829,dby,"And he said, Is it not therefore he was named Jacob, for he has supplanted me now twice? He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?"
3830,dby,"And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him lord over thee, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants, and with corn and new wine have I supplied him -- and what can I do now for thee, my son?"
3831,dby,"And Esau said to his father, Hast thou then but one blessing, my father? bless me -- me also, my father! And Esau lifted up his voice and wept."
3832,dby,"And Isaac his father answered and said to him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth, And of the dew of heaven from above;"
3833,dby,"And by thy sword shalt thou live; And thou shalt serve thy brother; And it shall come to pass when thou rovest about, That thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck."
3834,dby,"And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him. And Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand, and I will slay my brother Jacob."
3835,dby,"And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebecca. And she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, comforts himself that he will kill thee."
3836,dby,"And now, my son, hearken to my voice, and arise, flee to Laban my brother, to Haran;"
3837,dby,"and abide with him some days, until thy brother's fury turn away --"
3838,dby,"until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget what thou hast done to him; then I will send and fetch thee thence. Why should I be bereaved even of you both in one day?"
3839,dby,"And Rebecca said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good should my life do me?"
3840,dby,"And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said to him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan."
3841,dby,"Arise, go to Padan-Aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father, and take a wife thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother."
3842,dby,"And the Almighty ÌÄå_God bless thee, and make thee fruitful and multiply thee, that thou mayest become a company of peoples."
3843,dby,"And may he give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee and to thy seed with thee, in order that thou mayest possess the land of thy sojourning, which God gave to Abraham!"
3844,dby,"And Isaac sent away Jacob; and he went to Padan-Aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebecca, Jacob's and Esau's mother."
3845,dby,"And Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-Aram, to take a wife thence, blessing him, and giving him a charge saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;"
3846,dby,"and [that] Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padan-Aram."
3847,dby,And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the sight of Isaac his father.
3848,dby,"And Esau went to Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife."
3849,dby,"And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went towards Haran."
3850,dby,"And he lighted on a certain place, and lodged there, because the sun had set. And he took [one] of the stones of the place, and made [it] his pillow, and lay down in that place."
3851,dby,"And he dreamed, and behold, a ladder was set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to the heavens. And behold, angels of God ascended and descended upon it."
3852,dby,"And behold, Jehovah stood above it. And he said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham, thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land on which thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed."
3853,dby,"And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south; and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
3854,dby,"And behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all [places] to which thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee until I have done what I have spoken to thee of."
3855,dby,"And Jacob awoke from his sleep, and said, Surely Jehovah is in this place, and I knew [it] not."
3856,dby,"And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."
3857,dby,"And Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had made his pillow, and set it up [for] a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it."
3858,dby,And he called the name of that place Beth-el; but the name of that city was Luz at the first.
3859,dby,"And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and keep me on this road that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and a garment to put on,"
3860,dby,and I come again to my father's house in peace -- then shall Jehovah be my God.
3861,dby,"And this stone, which I have set up [for] a pillar, shall be God's house; and of all that thou wilt give me I will without fail give the tenth to thee."
3862,dby,"And Jacob continued his journey, and went into the land of the children of the east."
3863,dby,"And he looked, and behold, there was a well in the fields, and behold there, three flocks of sheep were lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks, and a great stone was at the mouth of the well."
3864,dby,"And when all the flocks were gathered there, they rolled the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the mouth of the well in its place."
3865,dby,"And Jacob said to them, My brethren, whence are ye? And they said, Of Haran are we."
3866,dby,"And he said to them, Do ye know Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We do know [him]."
3867,dby,"And he said to them, Is he well? And they said, [He is] well; and behold, there comes Rachel his daughter with the sheep."
3868,dby,"And he said, Behold, it is yet high day; it is not time that the cattle should be gathered together; water the sheep, and go, feed [them]."
3869,dby,"And they said, We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the mouth of the well, and we water the sheep."
3870,dby,"While he was still speaking to them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess."
3871,dby,"And it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the sheep of Laban his mother's brother."
3872,dby,"And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept."
3873,dby,"And Jacob told Rachel that he was a brother of her father, and that he was Rebecca's son; and she ran and told her father."
3874,dby,"And it came to pass when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house; and he told Laban all these things."
3875,dby,"And Laban said to him, Thou art indeed my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him a month's time."
3876,dby,"And Laban said to Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou serve me for nothing? tell me, what shall be thy wages?"
3877,dby,"And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger, Rachel."
3878,dby,And the eyes of Leah were tender; but Rachel was of beautiful form and beautiful countenance.
3879,dby,"And Jacob loved Rachel, and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter."
3880,dby,"And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee than that I should give her to another man: abide with me."
3881,dby,"And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they were in his eyes as single days, because he loved her."
3882,dby,"And Jacob said to Laban, Give [me] my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her."
3883,dby,"And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast."
3884,dby,"And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in to her."
3885,dby,"And Laban gave to her Zilpah, his maidservant, to be maidservant to Leah his daughter."
3886,dby,"And it came to pass in the morning, that behold, it was Leah. And he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done to me? Have I not served thee for Rachel? Why then hast thou deceived me?"
3887,dby,"And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn."
3888,dby,"Fulfil the week [with] this one: then we will give thee the other one also, for the service that thou shalt serve me yet seven other years."
3889,dby,"And Jacob did so, and fulfilled the week [with] this one, and he gave him Rachel his daughter to be his wife."
3890,dby,"And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, Bilhah, his maidservant, to be her maidservant."
3891,dby,And he went in also to Rachel; and he loved also Rachel more than Leah. And he served with him yet seven other years.
3892,dby,"And when Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren."
3893,dby,"And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and called his name Reuben; for she said, Because Jehovah has looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will love me."
3894,dby,"And she again conceived, and bore a son, and said, Because Jehovah has heard that I am hated, he has therefore given me this one also; and she called his name Simeon."
3895,dby,"And she again conceived, and bore a son, and said, Now this time will my husband be united to me, for I have borne him three sons; therefore was his name called Levi."
3896,dby,"And she again conceived, and bore a son, and said, This time will I praise Jehovah; therefore she called his name Judah. And she ceased to bear."
3897,dby,"And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister, and said to Jacob, Give me children, or else I die."
3898,dby,"And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said, Am I in God's stead, who has withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?"
3899,dby,"And she said, Behold, there is my maid, Bilhah: go in to her, in order that she may bear on my knees, and I may also be built up by her."
3900,dby,"And she gave him Bilhah her maidservant as wife, and Jacob went in to her."
3901,dby,"And Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son."
3902,dby,"And Rachel said, God has done me justice, and has also heard my voice, and given me a son; therefore she called his name Dan."
3903,dby,"And Bilhah Rachel's maidservant again conceived, and bore Jacob a second son."
3904,dby,"And Rachel said, Wrestlings of God have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed; and she called his name Naphtali."
3905,dby,"And when Leah saw that she had ceased to bear, she took Zilpah her maidservant and gave her to Jacob as wife."
3906,dby,And Zilpah Leah's maidservant bore Jacob a son.
3907,dby,"And Leah said, Fortunately! and she called his name Gad."
3908,dby,And Zilpah Leah's maidservant bore Jacob a second son.
3909,dby,"And Leah said, Happy am I; for the daughters will call me blessed! and she called his name Asher."
3910,dby,"And Reuben went out in the days of wheat-harvest, and found mandrakes in the fields; and he brought them to his mother Leah. And Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes."
3911,dby,"And she said to her, Is it [too] little that thou hast taken my husband, that thou wilt take my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son's mandrakes."
3912,dby,"And when Jacob came from the fields in the evening, Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in to me, for indeed I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night."
3913,dby,"And God hearkened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son."
3914,dby,"And Leah said, God has given me my hire, because I have given my maidservant to my husband; and she called his name Issachar."
3915,dby,"And Leah again conceived, and bore Jacob a sixth son;"
3916,dby,"and Leah said, God has endowed me with a good dowry; this time will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons. And she called his name Zebulun."
3917,dby,"And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah."
3918,dby,"And God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb."
3919,dby,"And she conceived, and bore a son, and said, God has taken away my reproach."
3920,dby,"And she called his name Joseph; and said, Jehovah will add to me another son."
3921,dby,"And it came to pass when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my place and to my country."
3922,dby,"Give [me] my wives for whom I have served thee, and my children; that I may go away, for thou knowest my service which I have served thee."
3923,dby,"And Laban said to him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes -- I have discovered that Jehovah has blessed me for thy sake."
3924,dby,"And he said, Appoint to me thy wages, and I will give it."
3925,dby,"And he said to him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and what thy cattle has become with me."
3926,dby,"For it was little that thou hadst before me, and it is increased to a multitude, and Jehovah has blessed thee from the time I came; and now, when shall I also provide for my house?"
3927,dby,"And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me anything. If thou doest this for me, I will again feed [and] keep thy flock:"
3928,dby,"I will pass through all thy flock to-day, to remove thence all the speckled and spotted sheep, and all the brown lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and [that] shall be my hire."
3929,dby,"And my righteousness shall answer for me hereafter, when thou comest about my hire, before thy face: all that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the lambs, let that be stolen with me."
3930,dby,"And Laban said, Well, let it be according to thy word."
3931,dby,"And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the brown among the lambs, and gave [them] into the hand of his sons."
3932,dby,And he put three days' journey between himself and Jacob. And Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flock.
3933,dby,"And Jacob took fresh rods of white poplar, almond-tree, and maple; and peeled off white stripes in them, uncovering the white which was on the rods."
3934,dby,"And he set the rods which he had peeled before the flock, in the troughs at the watering-places where the flock came to drink, and they were ardent when they came to drink."
3935,dby,"And the flock was ardent before the rods; and the flock brought forth ringstraked, speckled, and spotted."
3936,dby,"And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flock toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he made himself separate flocks, and did not put them with Laban's flock."
3937,dby,"And it came to pass whensoever the strong cattle were ardent, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might become ardent among the rods;"
3938,dby,"but when the sheep were feeble, he put [them] not in; so the feeble were Laban's, and the strong Jacob's."
3939,dby,"And the man increased very, very much, and had much cattle, and bondwomen, and bondmen, and camels, and asses."
3940,dby,"And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob has taken away all that was our father's, and of what was our father's he has acquired all this glory."
3941,dby,"And Jacob saw the countenance of Laban, and behold, it was not toward him as previously."
3942,dby,"And Jehovah said to Jacob, Return into the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee."
3943,dby,"And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the fields to his flock,"
3944,dby,"and said to them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as previously; but the God of my father has been with me."
3945,dby,And you know that with all my power I have served your father.
3946,dby,"And your father has mocked me, and has changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me."
3947,dby,"If he said thus; The speckled shall be thy hire, then all the flocks bore speckled; and if he said thus: The ringstraked shall be thy hire, then all the flocks bore ringstraked."
3948,dby,"And God has taken away the cattle of your father, and given [them] to me."
3949,dby,"And it came to pass at the time of the ardour of the flocks, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams that leaped upon the flocks were ringstraked, speckled, and spotted."
3950,dby,"And the Angel of God said to me in a dream, Jacob! And I said, Here am I."
3951,dby,"And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see: all the rams that leap upon the flock are ringstraked, speckled, and spotted; for I have seen all that Laban does to thee."
3952,dby,"I am the ÌÄå_God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, where thou vowedst a vow to me. Now arise, depart out of this land, and return to the land of thy kindred."
3953,dby,"And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?"
3954,dby,"Are we not reckoned of him strangers? for he has sold us, and has even constantly devoured our money."
3955,dby,For all the wealth that God has taken from our father is ours and our children's; and now whatever God has said to thee do.
3956,dby,"And Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels,"
3957,dby,"and carried away all his cattle, and all his property that he had acquired -- the cattle of his possessions that he had acquired in Padan-Aram, to go to Isaac his father, into the land of Canaan."
3958,dby,And Laban had gone to shear his sheep. And Rachel stole the teraphim that [belonged] to her father.
3959,dby,"And Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he did not tell him that he fled."
3960,dby,"And he fled with all that he had; and he rose up and passed over the river, and set his face [toward] mount Gilead."
3961,dby,And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled.
3962,dby,"And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey, and overtook him on mount Gilead."
3963,dby,"And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said to him, Take care thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
3964,dby,And Laban came up with Jacob; and Jacob had pitched his tent on the mountain; Laban also with his brethren pitched on mount Gilead.
3965,dby,"And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast deceived me, and hast carried away my daughters as captives of war?"
3966,dby,"Why didst thou flee away covertly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have conducted thee with mirth and with songs, with tambour and with harp;"
3967,dby,and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now thou hast acted foolishly.
3968,dby,"It would be in the power of my hand to do you hurt; but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, Take care that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
3969,dby,"And now that thou must needs be gone, because thou greatly longedst after thy father's house, why hast thou stolen my gods?"
3970,dby,"And Jacob answered and said to Laban, I was afraid; for I said, Lest thou shouldest take by force thy daughters from me."
3971,dby,"With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live. Before our brethren discern what is thine with me, and take [it] to thee. But Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them."
3972,dby,"And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two handmaids' tents, and found nothing; and he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent."
3973,dby,"Now Rachel had taken the teraphim and put them under the camel's saddle; and she sat upon them. And Laban explored all the tent, but found nothing."
3974,dby,"And she said to her father, Let it not be an occasion of anger in the eyes of my lord that I cannot rise up before thee, for it is with me after the manner of women. And he searched carefully, but did not find the teraphim."
3975,dby,"And Jacob was angry, and he disputed with Laban. And Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my fault, what my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?"
3976,dby,"Whereas thou hast explored all my baggage, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Set [it] here before my brethren and thy brethren, and let them decide between us both."
3977,dby,"These twenty years have I been with thee: thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock I have not eaten."
3978,dby,"What was torn I have not brought to thee; I had to bear the loss of it: of my hand hast thou required it, [whether] stolen by day or stolen by night."
3979,dby,"Thus it was with me: in the day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from mine eyes."
3980,dby,"I have been these twenty years in thy house: I have served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock; and thou hast changed my wages ten times."
3981,dby,"Had not the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, been with me, it is certain thou wouldest have sent me away now empty. God has looked upon my affliction and the labour of my hands, and has judged last night."
3982,dby,"And Laban answered and said to Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the sons are my sons, and the flock is my flock, and all that thou seest is mine; but as for my daughters, what can I do this day to them, or to their sons whom they have brought forth?"
3983,dby,"And now, come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be a witness between me and thee."
3984,dby,"And Jacob took a stone, and set it up [for] a pillar."
3985,dby,"And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones. And they took stones, and made a heap, and ate there upon the heap."
3986,dby,"And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed."
3987,dby,"And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed,"
3988,dby,"-- and Mizpah; for he said, Let Jehovah watch between me and thee, when we shall be hidden one from another:"
3989,dby,"if thou shouldest afflict my daughters, or if thou shouldest take wives besides my daughters, -- no man is with us; see, God is witness between me and thee!"
3990,dby,"And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar which I have set up between me and thee:"
3991,dby,"[let] this heap be witness, and the pillar a witness, that neither I pass this heap [to go] to thee, nor thou pass this heap and this pillar [to come] to me, for harm."
3992,dby,"The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us! And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac."
3993,dby,"And Jacob offered a sacrifice upon the mountain, and invited his brethren to eat bread: and they ate bread, and lodged on the mountain."
3994,dby,"And Laban rose early in the morning, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them; and Laban went and returned to his place."
3995,dby,And Jacob went on his way; and the angels of God met him.
3996,dby,"And when Jacob saw them he said, This is the camp of God. And he called the name of that place Mahanaim."
3997,dby,"And Jacob sent messengers before his face to Esau his brother, into the land of Seir, the fields of Edom."
3998,dby,"And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak to my lord, to Esau: Thy servant Jacob speaks thus -- With Laban have I sojourned and tarried until now;"
3999,dby,"and I have oxen, and asses, sheep, and bondmen, and bondwomen; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favour in thine eyes."
4000,dby,"And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother, to Esau; and he also is coming to meet thee, and four hundred men with him."
4001,dby,"Then Jacob was greatly afraid, and was distressed; and he divided the people that were with him, and the sheep and the cattle and the camels, into two troops."
4002,dby,"And he said, If Esau come to the one troop and smite it, then the other troop which is left shall escape."
4003,dby,"And Jacob said, God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Jehovah, who saidst unto me: Return into thy country and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good,"
4004,dby,"-- I am too small for all the loving-kindness and all the faithfulness that thou hast shewn unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two troops."
4005,dby,"Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, [and] the mother with the children."
4006,dby,"And thou saidst, I will certainly deal well with thee, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude."
4007,dby,And he lodged there that night; and took of what came to his hand a gift for Esau his brother --
4008,dby,"two hundred she-goats, and twenty he-goats; two hundred ewes, and twenty rams;"
4009,dby,"thirty milch camels with their colts; forty kine, and ten bulls; twenty she-asses, and ten young asses."
4010,dby,"And he delivered [them] into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself; and he said to his servants, Go on before me, and put a space between drove and drove."
4011,dby,"And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets thee, and asks thee, saying, Whose art thou, and where goest thou, and whose are these before thee?"
4012,dby,"-- then thou shalt say, Thy servant Jacob's: it is a gift sent to my lord, to Esau. And behold, he also is behind us."
4013,dby,"And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, According to this word shall ye speak to Esau when ye find him."
4014,dby,"And, moreover, ye shall say, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will propitiate him with the gift that goes before me, and afterwards I will see his face: perhaps he will accept me."
4015,dby,And the gift went over before him; and he himself lodged that night in the camp.
4016,dby,"And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two maidservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok;"
4017,dby,"and he took them and led them over the river, and led over what he had."
4018,dby,And Jacob remained alone; and a man wrestled with him until the rising of the dawn.
4019,dby,"And when he saw that he did not prevail against him, he touched the joint of his thigh; and the joint of Jacob's thigh was dislocated as he wrestled with him."
4020,dby,"And he said, Let me go, for the dawn ariseth. And he said, I will not let thee go except thou bless me."
4021,dby,"And he said to him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob."
4022,dby,"And he said, Thy name shall not henceforth be called Jacob, but Israel; for thou hast wrestled with God, and with men, and hast prevailed."
4023,dby,"And Jacob asked and said, Tell [me], I pray thee, thy name. And he said, How is it that thou askest after my name? And he blessed him there."
4024,dby,"And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel -- For I have seen God face to face, and my life has been preserved."
4025,dby,"And as he passed over Peniel, the sun rose upon him; and he limped upon his hip."
4026,dby,"Therefore the children of Israel do not eat of the sinew that is over the joint of the thigh, to this day; because he touched the joint of Jacob's thigh -- the sinew."
4027,dby,"And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. And he distributed the children to Leah, and to Rachel, and to the two maidservants:"
4028,dby,"and he put the maidservants and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindmost."
4029,dby,"And he passed on before them, and bowed to the earth seven times, until he came near to his brother."
4030,dby,"And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him; and they wept."
4031,dby,"And he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children, and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The children that God has graciously given thy servant."
4032,dby,"And the maidservants drew near, they and their children, and they bowed."
4033,dby,"And Leah also, with her children, drew near, and they bowed. And lastly Joseph drew near, and Rachel, and they bowed."
4034,dby,"And he said, What [meanest] thou by all the drove which I met? And he said, To find favour in the eyes of my lord."
4035,dby,"And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; let what thou hast be thine."
4036,dby,"And Jacob said, No, I pray thee; if now I have found favour in thine eyes, then receive my gift from my hand; for therefore have I seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou hast received me with pleasure."
4037,dby,"Take, I pray thee, my blessing which has been brought to thee; because God has been gracious to me, and because I have everything. And he urged him, and he took [it]."
4038,dby,"And he said, Let us take our journey, and go on, and I will go before thee."
4039,dby,"And he said to him, My lord knows that the children are tender, and the suckling sheep and kine are with me; and if they should overdrive them only one day, all the flock would die."
4040,dby,"Let my lord, I pray thee, pass on before his servant, and I will drive on at my ease according to the pace of the cattle that is before me, and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord, to Seir."
4041,dby,"And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee [some] of the people that are with me. And he said, What need? Let me find favour in the eyes of my lord."
4042,dby,And Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
4043,dby,"And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built himself a house, and for his cattle he made booths. Therefore the name of the place was called Succoth."
4044,dby,"And Jacob came safely [to the] city Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-Aram; and he encamped before the city."
4045,dby,"And he bought the portion of the field where he had spread his tent, of the hand of the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred kesitahs."
4046,dby,"And there he set up an altar, and called it El-Elohe-Israel."
4047,dby,"And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land."
4048,dby,"And when Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and humbled her."
4049,dby,"And his soul fastened on Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the maiden, and spoke consolingly to the maiden."
4050,dby,"And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Take me this girl as wife."
4051,dby,"And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; but his sons were with his cattle in the fields, and Jacob said nothing until they came."
4052,dby,"And Hamor the father of Shechem came out to Jacob, to speak to him."
4053,dby,"And the sons of Jacob came from the fields when they heard [it]; and the men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had wrought what was disgraceful in Israel, in lying with Jacob's daughter, which thing ought not to be done."
4054,dby,"And Hamor spoke to them, saying, My son Shechem's soul cleaves to your daughter: I pray you, give her to him as wife."
4055,dby,"And make marriages with us: give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to you."
4056,dby,"And dwell with us, and the land shall be before you: dwell and trade in it, and get yourselves possessions in it."
4057,dby,"And Shechem said to her father and to her brethren, Let me find favour in your eyes; and what ye shall say to me I will give."
4058,dby,"Impose on me very much as dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say to me; but give me the maiden as wife."
4059,dby,"And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and spoke -- because he had defiled Dinah their sister --"
4060,dby,"and said to them, We cannot do this, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that [were] a reproach to us."
4061,dby,"But only in this will we consent to you, if ye will be as we, that every male of you be circumcised;"
4062,dby,"then will we give our daughters to you, and take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and be one people."
4063,dby,"But if ye do not hearken to us, to be circumcised, then will we take our daughter and go away."
4064,dby,"And their words were good in the eyes of Hamor and Shechem, Hamor's son."
4065,dby,"And the youth did not delay to do this, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter. And he was honourable above all in the house of his father."
4066,dby,"And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and spoke to the men of their city, saying,"
4067,dby,"These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade in it. And the land -- behold, it is of wide extent before them. We will take their daughters as wives, and give them our daughters."
4068,dby,"But only in this will the men consent to us to dwell with us, to be one people -- if every male among us be circumcised, just as they are circumcised."
4069,dby,"Their cattle, and their possessions, and every beast of theirs, shall they not be ours? only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us."
4070,dby,And all that went out at the gate of his city hearkened to Hamor and to Shechem his son; and every male was circumcised -- all that went out at the gate of his city.
4071,dby,"And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males."
4072,dby,And Hamor and Shechem his son they slew with the edge of the sword; and took Dinah out of Shechem's house; and went out.
4073,dby,"The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister."
4074,dby,"Their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and what [was] in the city, and what [was] in the field they took;"
4075,dby,"and all their goods, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and plundered them, and all that was in the houses."
4076,dby,"And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, in that ye make me odious among the inhabitants of the land -- among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and I am few men in number, and they will gather themselves against me and smite me, and I shall be destroyed, I and my house."
4077,dby,"And they said, Should people deal with our sister as with a harlot?"
4078,dby,"And God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there, and make there an altar unto the ÌÄå_God that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother."
4079,dby,"And Jacob said to his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and cleanse yourselves, and change your garments;"
4080,dby,"and we will arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar to the ÌÄå_God that answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way that I went."
4081,dby,"And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods that were in their hand, and the rings that were in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the terebinth that [is] by Shechem."
4082,dby,"And they journeyed; and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob."
4083,dby,"And Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him."
4084,dby,"And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el; because there God had appeared to him when he fled from the face of his brother."
4085,dby,"And Deborah, Rebecca's nurse, died; and she was buried beneath Bethel, under the oak; and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth."
4086,dby,"And God appeared to Jacob again after he had come from Padan-Aram, and blessed him."
4087,dby,"And God said to him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not henceforth be called Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name. And he called his name Israel."
4088,dby,"And God said to him, I am the Almighty ÌÄå_God: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee; and kings shall come out of thy loins."
4089,dby,"And the land that I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land."
4090,dby,And God went up from him in the place where he had talked with him.
4091,dby,"And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had talked with him, a pillar of stone, and poured on it a drink-offering, and poured oil on it."
4092,dby,"And Jacob called the name of the place where God had talked with him, Beth-el."
4093,dby,"And they journeyed from Bethel. And there was yet a certain distance to come to Ephrath, when Rachel travailed in childbirth; and it went hard with her in her childbearing."
4094,dby,"And it came to pass when it went hard with her in her childbearing, that the midwife said to her, Fear not; for this also is a son for thee."
4095,dby,And it came to pass as her soul was departing -- for she died -- that she called his name Benoni; but his father called him Benjamin.
4096,dby,"And Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath, which [is] Bethlehem."
4097,dby,And Jacob erected a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave to [this] day.
4098,dby,"And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent on the other side of Migdal-Eder."
4099,dby,"And it came to pass when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father's concubine; and Israel heard of it. And the sons of Jacob were twelve."
4100,dby,"The sons of Leah: Reuben -- Jacob's firstborn -- and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun."
4101,dby,The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
4102,dby,"And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant: Dan and Naphtali."
4103,dby,"And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's maidservant: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob that were born to him in Padan-Aram."
4104,dby,"And Jacob came to Isaac his father to Mamre -- to Kirjath-Arba, which is Hebron; where Abraham had sojourned, and Isaac."
4105,dby,And the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years.
4106,dby,"And Isaac expired and died, and was gathered to his peoples, old and full of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him."
4107,dby,"And these are the generations of Esau, that is Edom."
4108,dby,"Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,"
4109,dby,"and Basmath Ishmael's daughter, the sister of Nebaioth."
4110,dby,And Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz; and Basmath bore Reuel.
4111,dby,And Oholibamah bore Jeush and Jaalam and Korah. These are the sons of Esau that were born to him in the land of Canaan.
4112,dby,"And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his possessions, that he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and went into a country away from his brother Jacob."
4113,dby,"For their property was too great for them to dwell together, and the land where they were sojourners could not bear them, because of their cattle."
4114,dby,Thus Esau dwelt in mount Seir; Esau is Edom.
4115,dby,"And these are the generations of Esau, the father of Edom, in mount Seir."

4137,dby,And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom before there reigned a king over the children of Israel.
4138,dby,And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom; and the name of his city was Dinhabah.
4139,dby,And Bela died; and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.
4140,dby,And Jobab died; and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead.

4148,dby,"chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,"
4149,dby,"chief Magdiel, chief Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom, according to their dwelling-places in the land of their possession. This is Esau, the father of Edom."
4150,dby,And Jacob dwelt in the land where his father sojourned -- in the land of Canaan.
4151,dby,"These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, fed the flock with his brethren; and he was doing service with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives. And Joseph brought to his father an evil report of them."
4152,dby,"And Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was son of his old age; and he made him a vest of many colours."
4153,dby,"And his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, and they hated him, and could not greet him with friendliness."
4154,dby,"And Joseph dreamed a dream, and told [it] to his brethren, and they hated him yet the more."
4155,dby,"And he said to them, Hear, I pray you, this dream, which I have dreamt:"
4156,dby,"Behold, we were binding sheaves in the fields, and lo, my sheaf rose up, and remained standing; and behold, your sheaves came round about and bowed down to my sheaf."
4157,dby,"And his brethren said to him, Wilt thou indeed be a king over us? wilt thou indeed rule over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words."
4158,dby,"And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamt another dream, and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me."
4159,dby,"And he told [it] to his father and to his brethren. And his father rebuked him, and said to him, What is this dream which thou hast dreamt? Shall we indeed come, I and thy mother and thy brethren, to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?"
4160,dby,And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the saying.
4161,dby,And his brethren went to feed their father's flock at Shechem.
4162,dby,"And Israel said to Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed [the flock] at Shechem? Come, that I may send thee to them. And he said to him, Here am I."
4163,dby,"And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see after the welfare of thy brethren, and after the welfare of the flock; and bring me word again. And he sent him out of the vale of Hebron; and he came towards Shechem."
4164,dby,"And a man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the country; and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?"
4165,dby,"And he said, I am seeking my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed [their flocks]."
4166,dby,"And the man said, They have removed from this; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them at Dothan."
4167,dby,"And when they saw him from afar, and before he came near to them, they conspired against him to put him to death."
4168,dby,"And they said one to another, Behold, there comes that dreamer!"
4169,dby,"And now come and let us kill him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, An evil beast has devoured him; and we will see what becomes of his dreams."
4170,dby,"And Reuben heard [it], and delivered him out of their hand, and said, Let us not take his life."
4171,dby,"And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood: cast him into this pit which is in the wilderness; but lay no hand upon him -- in order that he might deliver him out of their hand, to bring him to his father again."
4172,dby,"And it came to pass when Joseph came to his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his vest, the vest of many colours, which he had on;"
4173,dby,and they took him and cast him into the pit; now the pit was empty -- there was no water in it.
4174,dby,"And they sat down to eat bread; and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites came from Gilead; and their camels bore tragacanth, and balsam, and ladanum -- going to carry [it] down to Egypt."
4175,dby,"And Judah said to his brethren, What profit is it that we kill our brother and secrete his blood?"
4176,dby,"Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites; but let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brethren hearkened [to him]."
4177,dby,"And Midianitish men, merchants, passed by; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty silver-pieces; and they brought Joseph to Egypt."
4178,dby,"And Reuben returned to the pit, and behold, Joseph [was] not in the pit; and he rent his garments,"
4179,dby,"and returned to his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, where shall I go?"
4180,dby,"And they took Joseph's vest, and slaughtered a buck of the goats, and dipped the vest in the blood;"
4181,dby,"and they sent the vest of many colours and had it carried to their father, and said, This have we found: discern now whether it is thy son's vest or not."
4182,dby,"And he discerned it, and said, [It is] my son's vest! an evil beast has devoured him: Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces!"
4183,dby,"And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days."
4184,dby,"And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted, and said, For I will go down to my son into Sheol mourning. Thus his father wept for him."
4185,dby,"And the Midianites sold him into Egypt, to Potiphar, a chamberlain of Pharaoh, the captain of the life-guard."
4186,dby,"And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a man of Adullam whose name was Hirah."
4187,dby,"And Judah saw there the daughter of a Canaanitish man whose name was Shua; and he took her, and went in to her."
4188,dby,And she conceived and bore a son; and he called his name Er.
4189,dby,"And she again conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Onan."
4190,dby,"And again she bore a son, and she called his name Shelah; and he was at Chezib when she bore him."
4191,dby,"And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar."
4192,dby,"And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of Jehovah, and Jehovah slew him."
4193,dby,"Then Judah said to Onan, Go in to thy brother's wife, and fulfil to her the brother-in-law's duty, and raise up seed to thy brother."
4194,dby,"But when Onan knew that the seed should not be his own, it came to pass when he went in to his brother's wife, that he spilled [it] on the ground, in order to give no seed to his brother."
4195,dby,"And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and he slew him also."
4196,dby,"And Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in thy father's house, until Shelah my son is grown; for he said, Lest he die also, as his brethren. And Tamar went and remained in her father's house."
4197,dby,"And as the days were multiplied, Judah's wife, the daughter of Shua, died. And Judah was comforted, and he went up to his sheep-shearers, to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite."
4198,dby,"And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep."
4199,dby,"And she put the garments of her widowhood off from her, and covered herself with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the entry of Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him as wife."
4200,dby,"And Judah saw her, and took her for a harlot; because she had covered her face."
4201,dby,"And he turned aside to her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me go in to thee; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in to me?"
4202,dby,"And he said, I will send [thee] a kid of the goats from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give [me] a pledge, until thou send it?"
4203,dby,"And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy lace, and thy staff which is in thy hand. And he gave [it] her, and went in to her; and she conceived by him."
4204,dby,"And she arose and went away; and she laid by her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood."
4205,dby,"And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand; but he found her not."
4206,dby,"And he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute that was at Enaim, by the way-side? And they said, There was no prostitute here."
4207,dby,"And he returned to Judah, and said, I have not found her; and also the men of the place said, No prostitute has been here."
4208,dby,"Then Judah said, Let her take [it] for herself, lest we be put to shame. Behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her."
4209,dby,"And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law has committed fornication, and behold, she is also with child by fornication. And Judah said, Bring her forth, that she may be burned."
4210,dby,"When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man to whom these [belong] am I with child; and she said, Acknowledge, I pray thee, whose are this signet, and this lace, and this staff."
4211,dby,"And Judah acknowledged [them], and said, She is more righteous than I, because I have not given her to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more."
4212,dby,"And it came to pass at the time of her delivery, that behold, twins were in her womb."
4213,dby,"And it came to pass when she brought forth, that one stretched out [his] hand, and the midwife took it and bound round his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first."
4214,dby,"And it came to pass as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out; and she said, How hast thou broken forth! on thee be the breach! And they called his name Pherez."
4215,dby,"And afterwards came out his brother, round whose hand was the scarlet thread; and they called his name Zerah."
4216,dby,"And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, a chamberlain of Pharaoh, the captain of the life-guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hand of the Ishmaelites who had brought him down thither."
4217,dby,"And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian."
4218,dby,"And his master saw that Jehovah was with him, and that Jehovah made all that he did to prosper in his hand."
4219,dby,"And Joseph found favour in his eyes, and attended on him; and he set him over his house, and all that he had he gave into his hand."
4220,dby,"And it came to pass from the time he had set him over his house and all that he had, that Jehovah blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of Jehovah was on all that he had in the house and in the field."
4221,dby,"And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand, and took cognizance of nothing with him, save the bread that he ate. And Joseph was of a beautiful form and of a beautiful countenance."
4222,dby,"And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph, and said, Lie with me!"
4223,dby,"But he refused, and said to his master's wife, Behold, my master takes cognizance of nothing with me: what is in the house, and all that he has, he has given into my hand."
4224,dby,"There is none greater in this house than I; neither has he withheld anything from me but thee, because thou art his wife; and how should I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"
4225,dby,"And it came to pass as she spoke to Joseph day by day and he hearkened not to her, to lie with her [and] to be with her,"
4226,dby,"that on a certain day he went into the house to do his business, and there was none of the men of the house there in the house."
4227,dby,"Then she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me! But he left his garment in her hand, and fled and ran out."
4228,dby,"And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled forth,"
4229,dby,"that she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, See, he has brought in a Hebrew man to us, to mock us: he came in to me, to lie with me; and I cried with a loud voice;"
4230,dby,"and it came to pass when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled and went out."
4231,dby,And she laid his garment by her until his lord came home.
4232,dby,"And she spoke to him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew bondman that thou hast brought to us came in to me to mock me;"
4233,dby,"and it came to pass as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled forth."
4234,dby,"And it came to pass when his lord heard the words of his wife which she spoke to him, saying, After this manner did thy bondman to me, that his wrath was kindled."
4235,dby,"And Joseph's lord took him and put him into the tower-house, [the] place where the king's prisoners were confined; and he was there in the tower-house."
4236,dby,"And Jehovah was with Joseph, and extended mercy to him, and gave him favour in the eyes of the chief of the tower-house."
4237,dby,And the chief of the tower-house committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the tower-house; and whatever they had to do there he did.
4238,dby,"The chief of the tower-house looked not to anything under his hand, because Jehovah was with him; and what he did, Jehovah made it prosper."
4239,dby,"And it came to pass after these things, [that] the cup-bearer of the king of Egypt and the baker offended their lord the king of Egypt."
4240,dby,And Pharaoh was wroth with his two chamberlains -- with the chief of the cup-bearers and with the chief of the bakers;
4241,dby,"and he put them in custody into the house of the captain of the life-guard, into the tower-house, into the place where Joseph was imprisoned."
4242,dby,"And the captain of the life-guard appointed Joseph to them, that he should attend on them. And they were [several] days in custody."
4243,dby,"And they dreamed a dream, both of them in one night, each his dream, each according to the interpretation of his dream, the cup-bearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were imprisoned in the tower-house."
4244,dby,"And Joseph came in to them in the morning, and looked on them, and behold, they were sad."
4245,dby,"And he asked Pharaoh's chamberlains that were with him in custody in his lord's house, saying, Why are your faces [so] sad to-day?"
4246,dby,"And they said to him, We have dreamt a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, [Do] not interpretations [belong] to God? tell me [your dreams], I pray you."
4247,dby,"Then the chief of the cup-bearers told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;"
4248,dby,"and in the vine were three branches; and it was as though it budded: its blossoms shot forth, its clusters ripened into grapes."
4249,dby,"And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand."
4250,dby,"And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days."
4251,dby,"In yet three days will Pharaoh lift up thy head and restore thee to thy place, and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his cup-bearer."
4252,dby,"Only bear a remembrance with thee of me when it goes well with thee, and deal kindly, I pray thee, with me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house;"
4253,dby,"for indeed I was stolen out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon."
4254,dby,"And when the chief of the bakers saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also was in my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head."
4255,dby,"And in the uppermost basket there were all manner of victuals for Pharaoh that the baker makes, and the birds ate them out of the basket upon my head."
4256,dby,"And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation of it: the three baskets are three days."
4257,dby,"In yet three days will Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and hang thee on a tree; and the birds will eat thy flesh from off thee."
4258,dby,"And it came to pass the third day -- Pharaoh's birthday -- that he made a feast to all his bondmen. And he lifted up the head of the chief of the cup-bearers, and the head of the chief of the bakers among his bondmen."
4259,dby,And he restored the chief of the cup-bearers to his office of cup-bearer again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
4260,dby,"And he hanged the chief of the bakers, as Joseph had interpreted to them."
4261,dby,"But the chief of the cup-bearers did not remember Joseph, and forgot him."
4262,dby,"And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed, and behold, he stood by the river."
4263,dby,"And behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fine-looking and fat-fleshed, and they fed in the reed-grass."
4264,dby,"And behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, bad-looking and lean-fleshed, and stood by the kine on the bank of the river."
4265,dby,And the kine that were bad-looking and lean-fleshed ate up the seven kine that were fine-looking and fat. And Pharaoh awoke.
4266,dby,"And he slept and dreamed the second time; and behold, seven ears of corn grew up on one stalk, fat and good."
4267,dby,"And behold, seven ears, thin and parched with the east wind, sprung up after them."
4268,dby,"And the thin ears devoured the seven fat and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke; and behold, it was a dream."
4269,dby,"And it came to pass in the morning, that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the scribes of Egypt, and all the sages who were therein, and Pharaoh told them his dream; but [there was] none to interpret them to Pharaoh."
4270,dby,"Then spoke the chief of the cup-bearers to Pharaoh, saying, I remember mine offences this day."
4271,dby,"Pharaoh was wroth with his bondmen, and put me in custody into the captain of the life-guard's house, me and the chief of the bakers."
4272,dby,"And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each according to the interpretation of his dream."
4273,dby,"And there was there with us a Hebrew youth, a bondman of the captain of the life-guard, to whom we told [them], and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each he interpreted according to his dream."
4274,dby,"And it came to pass, just as he interpreted to us, so it came about: me has he restored to my office, and him he hanged."
4275,dby,"Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph; and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. And he shaved [himself], and changed his clothes, and came in to Pharaoh."
4276,dby,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamt a dream, and there is none to interpret it. And I have heard say of thee, thou understandest a dream to interpret it."
4277,dby,"And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace."
4278,dby,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood on the bank of the river."
4279,dby,"And behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fat-fleshed and of fine form, and they fed in the reed-grass."
4280,dby,"And behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor, and very ill-formed, and lean-fleshed -- such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness."
4281,dby,And the lean and bad kine ate up the seven first fat kine;
4282,dby,"and they came into their belly, and it could not be known that they had come into their belly; and their look was bad, as at the beginning. And I awoke."
4283,dby,"And I saw in my dream, and behold, seven ears came up on one stalk, full and good."
4284,dby,"And behold, seven ears, withered, thin, parched with the east wind, sprung up after them;"
4285,dby,and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears. And I told it to the scribes; but there was none to make it known to me.
4286,dby,"And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one. What God will do he has made known to Pharaoh."
4287,dby,The seven fine kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.
4288,dby,"And the seven lean and bad kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears, parched with the east wind, will be seven years of famine."
4289,dby,This is the word which I have spoken to Pharaoh: what God is about to do he has let Pharaoh see.
4290,dby,"Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout the land of Egypt."
4291,dby,"And there will arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine will waste away the land."
4292,dby,And the plenty will not be known afterwards in the land by reason of that famine; for it will be very grievous.
4293,dby,"And as regards the double repetition of the dream to Pharaoh, it is that the thing is established by God, and God will hasten to do it."
4294,dby,"And now let Pharaoh look himself out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt."
4295,dby,"Let Pharaoh do [this]: let him appoint overseers over the land, and take the fifth part of the land of Egypt during the seven years of plenty,"
4296,dby,"and let them gather all the food of these coming good years, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, for food in the cities, and keep [it]."
4297,dby,"And let the food be as store for the land for the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt, that the land perish not through the famine."
4298,dby,"And the word was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his bondmen."
4299,dby,"And Pharaoh said to his bondmen, Shall we find [one] as this, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?"
4300,dby,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Since God has made all this known to thee, there is none [so] discreet and wise as thou."
4301,dby,"Thou shalt be over my house, and according to thy commandment shall all my people regulate themselves; only concerning the throne will I be greater than thou."
4302,dby,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt."
4303,dby,"And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in clothes of byssus, and put a gold chain on his neck."
4304,dby,"And he caused him to ride in the second chariot that he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee! and he set him over all the land of Egypt."
4305,dby,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh; and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt."
4306,dby,"And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah, and gave him as wife Asnath the daughter of Potipherah the priest in On. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt."
4307,dby,"And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaoh, and passed through the whole land of Egypt."
4308,dby,And in the seven years of plenty the land brought forth by handfuls.
4309,dby,"And he gathered up all the food of the seven years that was in the land of Egypt, and put the food in the cities; the food of the fields of the city, which were round about it, he laid up in it."
4310,dby,"And Joseph laid up corn as sand of the sea exceeding much, until they left off numbering; for it was without number."
4311,dby,"And to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asnath the daughter of Potipherah the priest in On bore to him."
4312,dby,"And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh -- For God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house."
4313,dby,And the name of the second he called Ephraim -- For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
4314,dby,And the seven years of plenty that were in the land of Egypt were ended;
4315,dby,"and the seven years of the dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said. And there was dearth in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread."
4316,dby,"And all the land of Egypt suffered from the dearth. And the people cried to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph: what he says to you, that do."
4317,dby,"And the famine was on all the earth. And Joseph opened every place in which there was [provision], and sold grain to the Egyptians; and the famine was grievous in the land of Egypt."
4318,dby,"And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph, to buy [grain], because the famine was grievous on the whole earth."
4319,dby,"And Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?"
4320,dby,"And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down thither and buy [grain] for us from thence, in order that we may live, and not die."
4321,dby,And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy [grain] out of Egypt.
4322,dby,"But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest mischief may befall him."
4323,dby,So the sons of Israel came to buy [grain] among those that came; for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
4324,dby,"And Joseph, he was the governor over the land -- he it was that sold [the corn] to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brethren came and bowed down to him, the face to the earth."
4325,dby,"And Joseph saw his brethren, and knew them; but he made himself strange to them, and spoke roughly to them, and said to them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan, to buy food."
4326,dby,"And Joseph knew his brethren, but they did not know him."
4327,dby,"And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamt of them; and he said to them, Ye are spies: to see the exposed places of the land ye are come."
4328,dby,"And they said to him, No, my lord; but to buy food are thy servants come."
4329,dby,We are all one man's sons; we are honest: thy servants are not spies.
4330,dby,"And he said to them, No; but to see the exposed places of the land are ye come."
4331,dby,"And they said, Thy servants were twelve brethren, sons of one man, in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not."
4332,dby,"And Joseph said to them, That is it that I have spoken to you, saying, Ye are spies."
4333,dby,"By this ye shall be put to the proof: as Pharaoh lives, ye shall not go forth hence, unless your youngest brother come hither!"
4334,dby,"Send one of you, that he may fetch your brother, but ye shall be imprisoned, and your words shall be put to the proof, whether the truth is in you; and if not, as Pharaoh lives, ye are spies."
4335,dby,And he put them in custody three days.
4336,dby,"And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, that ye may live: I fear God."
4337,dby,"If ye are honest, let one of your brethren remain bound in the house of your prison, but go ye, carry grain for the hunger of your households;"
4338,dby,"and bring your youngest brother to me, in order that your words be verified, and that ye may not die. And they did so."
4339,dby,"Then they said one to another, We are indeed guilty concerning our brother, whose anguish of soul we saw when he besought us, and we did not hearken; therefore this distress is come upon us."
4340,dby,"And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Do not sin against the lad? But ye did not hearken; and now behold, his blood also is required."
4341,dby,"And they did not know that Joseph understood, for the interpreter was between them."
4342,dby,"And he turned away from them, and wept. And he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes."
4343,dby,"And Joseph gave orders to fill their vessels with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way. And thus did they to them."
4344,dby,"And they loaded their asses with their grain, and departed thence."
4345,dby,"And one of them opened his sack to give his ass food in the inn, and saw his money, and behold, it was in the mouth of his sack."
4346,dby,"And he said to his brethren, My money is returned [to me], and behold, it is even in my sack. And their heart failed [them], and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this [that] God has done to us?"
4347,dby,"And they came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father, and told him all that had befallen them, saying,"
4348,dby,"The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and treated us as spies of the land."
4349,dby,"And we said to him, We are honest; we are not spies:"
4350,dby,"we are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan."
4351,dby,"And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, Hereby shall I know that ye are honest: leave one of your brethren with me, and take [for] the hunger of your households, and go,"
4352,dby,"and bring your youngest brother to me, and I shall know that ye are not spies, but are honest. Your brother will I give up to you; and ye may trade in the land."
4353,dby,"And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that behold, every man had his bundle of money in his sack; and they saw their bundles of money, they and their father, and were afraid."
4354,dby,"And Jacob their father said to them, Ye have bereaved me of children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin! All these things are against me."
4355,dby,"And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons if I bring him not back to thee: give him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again."
4356,dby,"But he said, My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he alone is left; and if mischief should befall him by the way in which ye go, then would ye bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to Sheol."
4357,dby,And the famine was grievous in the land.
4358,dby,"And it came to pass, when they had finished eating the grain which they had brought from Egypt, that their father said to them, Go again, buy us a little food."
4359,dby,"And Judah spoke to him, saying, The man did positively testify to us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, unless your brother be with you."
4360,dby,"If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food;"
4361,dby,"but if thou do not send [him], we will not go down, for the man said to us, Ye shall not see my face, unless your brother be with you."
4362,dby,"And Israel said, Why did ye deal [so] ill with me [as] to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?"
4363,dby,"And they said, The man asked very closely after us, and after our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye a brother? And we told him according to the tenor of these words. Could we at all know that he would say, Bring your brother down?"
4364,dby,"And Judah said to Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live, and not die, both we and thou and our little ones."
4365,dby,"I will be surety for him: of my hand shalt thou require him; if I bring him not to thee, and set him before thy face, then shall I be guilty toward thee for ever."
4366,dby,"For had we not lingered, we should now certainly have returned already twice."
4367,dby,"And their father Israel said to them, If it is then so, do this: take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a gift: a little balsam and a little honey, tragacanth and ladanum, pistacia-nuts and almonds."
4368,dby,"And take other money in your hand, and the money that was returned to you in the mouth of your sacks, carry back in your hand: perhaps it is an oversight."
4369,dby,"And take your brother, and arise, go again to the man."
4370,dby,"And the Almighty ÌÄå_God give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother and Benjamin! And I, if I be bereaved of children, am bereaved."
4371,dby,"And the men took that gift, and took double money in their hand, and Benjamin, and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and came before Joseph."
4372,dby,"And Joseph saw Benjamin with them, and said to the [man] who was over his house, Bring the men into the house, and slaughter cattle, and make ready; for the men shall eat with me at noon."
4373,dby,And the man did as Joseph had said; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
4374,dby,"And the men were afraid because they were brought into Joseph's house, and said, Because of the money that was returned to us in our sacks at the beginning are we brought in, that he may turn against us, and fall upon us and take us for bondmen, and our asses."
4375,dby,"And they came up to the man that was over Joseph's house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house,"
4376,dby,"and said, Ah! my lord, we came indeed down at the first to buy food."
4377,dby,"And it came to pass when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and behold, [every] man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money according to its weight; and we have brought it again in our hand."
4378,dby,And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.
4379,dby,"And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks; your money came to me. And he brought Simeon out to them."
4380,dby,"And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses food."
4381,dby,And they made ready the gift for Joseph's coming at noon; for they had heard that they should eat bread there.
4382,dby,"When Joseph came home, they brought him the gift that was in their hand, into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth."
4383,dby,"And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well -- the old man of whom ye spoke? Is he yet alive?"
4384,dby,"And they said, Thy servant our father is well; he is yet alive. And they bowed, and made obeisance."
4385,dby,"And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother of whom ye spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to thee, my son!"
4386,dby,"And Joseph made haste, for his bowels burned for his brother; and he sought [a place] to weep, and he went into the chamber, and wept there."
4387,dby,"And he washed his face, and came out, and controlled himself, and said, Set on bread."
4388,dby,"And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves; because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians."
4389,dby,"And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth; and the men marvelled one at another."
4390,dby,"And he had portions carried to them from before him. And Benjamin's portion was five times greater than the portions of them all. And they drank, and made merry with him."
4391,dby,"And he commanded him who was over his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry; and put every man's money in the mouth of his sack."
4392,dby,"And put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and his grain-money. And he did according to the word of Joseph which he had spoken."
4393,dby,"In the morning, when it was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses."
4394,dby,"They were gone out of the city, [and] not [yet] far off, when Joseph said to him who was over his house, Up! follow after the men; and when thou overtakest them, thou shalt say to them, Why have ye rewarded evil for good?"
4395,dby,"Is not this [it] in which my lord drinks, and in which indeed he divines? Ye have done evil [in] what ye have done."
4396,dby,"And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these words."
4397,dby,"And they said to him, Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from thy servants to do such a thing!"
4398,dby,"Behold, the money that we found in our sacks' mouths we have brought again to thee from the land of Canaan; and how should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?"
4399,dby,"With whomsoever of thy servants it is found, let him die; and we also will be my lord's bondmen."
4400,dby,"And he said, Now also [let] it [be] according to your words: let him with whom it is found be my bondman, but ye shall be blameless."
4401,dby,"And they hasted and laid down every man his sack on the ground, and opened every man his sack."
4402,dby,"And he searched carefully: he began at the eldest, and ended at the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack."
4403,dby,"Then they rent their clothes, and loaded every man his ass, and they returned to the city."
4404,dby,And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; and he was still there; and they fell down before him to the ground.
4405,dby,"And Joseph said to them, What deed is this which ye have done? Did ye not know that such a man as I can certainly divine?"
4406,dby,"And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak, and how justify ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of thy servants; behold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he in whose hand the cup has been found."
4407,dby,"And he said, Far be it from me to do so! The man in whose hand the cup has been found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, go up in peace to your father."
4408,dby,"Then Judah came near to him, and said, Ah! my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh."
4409,dby,"My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?"
4410,dby,"And we said to my lord, We have an aged father, and a child born to him in his old age, [yet] young; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves him."
4411,dby,"And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set mine eye on him."
4412,dby,"And we said to my lord, The youth cannot leave his father: if he should leave his father, [his father] would die."
4413,dby,"And thou saidst to thy servants, Unless your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more."
4414,dby,"And it came to pass when we came up to thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord."
4415,dby,"And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food."
4416,dby,"But we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down; for we cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us."
4417,dby,"And thy servant my father said to us, Ye know that my wife bore me two [sons];"
4418,dby,"and the one went out from me, and I said, He must certainly have been torn in pieces; and I have not seen him [again] hitherto."
4419,dby,"And if ye take this one also from me, and mischief should befall him, ye will bring down my grey hairs with misery to Sheol."
4420,dby,"And now, when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us, -- seeing that his life is bound up with his life,"
4421,dby,"it will come to pass when he sees that the lad is not [there], that he will die; and thy servants will bring down the grey hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol."
4422,dby,"For thy servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I bring him not to thee, then I shall be guilty toward my father all my days."
4423,dby,"And now, let thy servant stay, I pray thee, instead of the lad a bondman to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brethren;"
4424,dby,for how should I go up to my father if the lad were not with me? -- lest I see the evil that would come on my father.
4425,dby,"And Joseph could not control himself before all them that stood by him, and he cried, Put every man out from me! And no man stood with him when Joseph made himself known to his brethren."
4426,dby,"And he raised his voice in weeping; and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard."
4427,dby,"And Joseph said to his brethren, I am Joseph. Does my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him, for they were troubled at his presence."
4428,dby,"And Joseph said to his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt."
4429,dby,"And now, be not grieved, and be not angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither, for God sent me before you to preserve life."
4430,dby,For the famine has been these two years in the land; and yet there are five years in which there will be neither ploughing nor harvest.
4431,dby,"So God sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance."
4432,dby,"And now it was not you [that] sent me here, but God; and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and governor over all the land of Egypt."
4433,dby,"Haste and go up to my father, and say to him, Thus says thy son Joseph: God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, tarry not."
4434,dby,"And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near to me, thou, and thy sons, and thy sons' sons, and thy sheep, and thy cattle, and all that thou hast."
4435,dby,"And there will I maintain thee; for yet there are five years of famine; in order that thou be not impoverished, thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast."
4436,dby,"And behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth which speaks to you."
4437,dby,"And tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen, and haste and bring down my father hither."
4438,dby,"And he fell on his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept on his neck."
4439,dby,"And he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them; and after that his brethren talked with him."
4440,dby,"And the report was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come. And it was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his bondmen."
4441,dby,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to thy brethren, Do this: load your beasts and depart, go into the land of Canaan,"
4442,dby,"and take your father and your households, and come to me; and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land."
4443,dby,"And thou art commanded -- this do: take waggons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and take up your father, and come."
4444,dby,And let not your eye regret your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt shall be yours.
4445,dby,"And the sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them waggons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way."
4446,dby,To each one of them all he gave changes of clothing; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred [pieces] of silver and five changes of clothing.
4447,dby,"And to his father he sent this: ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with corn and bread, and food for his father by the way."
4448,dby,"And he sent his brethren away, and they departed. And he said to them, Do not quarrel on the way."
4449,dby,"And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan to Jacob their father."
4450,dby,"And they told him, saying, Joseph is still alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he did not believe them."
4451,dby,"And they spoke to him all the words of Joseph, which he had spoken to them. And he saw the waggons that Joseph had sent to carry him. And the spirit of Jacob their father revived."
4452,dby,"And Israel said, It is enough: Joseph my son is yet alive; I will go and see him before I die."
4453,dby,"And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba; and he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac."
4454,dby,"And God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night and said, Jacob, Jacob! And he said, Here am I."
4455,dby,"And he said, I am ÌÄå_God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down to Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation."
4456,dby,"I will go down with thee to Egypt, and I will also certainly bring thee up; and Joseph shall put his hand on thine eyes."
4457,dby,"And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba; and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, on the waggons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him."
4458,dby,"And they took their cattle, and their goods which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and came to Egypt, Jacob and all his seed with him;"

4460,dby,"And these are the names of the sons of Israel who came into Egypt: Jacob and his sons. Jacob's firstborn, Reuben."

4479,dby,"And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob that came to Egypt were seventy."
4480,dby,"And he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to give notice before he came to Goshen. And they came into the land of Goshen."
4481,dby,"Then Joseph yoked his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and he presented himself to him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while."
4482,dby,"And Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, after I have seen thy face, since thou still livest."
4483,dby,"And Joseph said to his brethren and to his father's house, I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and say to him, My brethren and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, are come to me;"
4484,dby,"and the men are shepherds, for they have been occupied with cattle; and they have brought their sheep, and their cattle, and all that they have."
4485,dby,"And it shall come to pass that when Pharaoh shall call you and say, What is your occupation?"
4486,dby,"then ye shall say, Thy servants are men that have been occupied with cattle from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers; in order that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians."
4487,dby,"And Joseph came and told Pharaoh and said, My father and my brethren, and their sheep and their cattle, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen."
4488,dby,"And he took from the whole number of his brethren, five men, and set them before Pharaoh."
4489,dby,"And Pharaoh said to his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we and our fathers."
4490,dby,"And they said to Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land are we come; for there is no pasture for the sheep that thy servants have, for the famine is grievous in the land of Canaan; and now, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen."
4491,dby,"And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come to thee."
4492,dby,"The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land settle thy father and thy brethren: let them dwell in the land of Goshen. And if thou knowest men of activity among them, then set them as overseers of cattle over what I have."
4493,dby,"And Joseph brought Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh."
4494,dby,"And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How many are the days of the years of thy life?"
4495,dby,"And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my sojourning are a hundred and thirty years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they do not attain to the days of the years of the life of my fathers, in the days of their sojourning."
4496,dby,"And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from Pharaoh."
4497,dby,"And Joseph settled his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded."
4498,dby,"And Joseph maintained his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to the number of the little ones."
4499,dby,And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very grievous; and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan were exhausted through the famine.
4500,dby,"And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house."
4501,dby,"And when money came to an end in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, saying, Give us bread! for why should we die before thee? for [our] money is all gone."
4502,dby,"And Joseph said, Give your cattle, and I will give you for your cattle, if [your] money be all gone."
4503,dby,"And they brought their cattle to Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread for horses, and for flocks of sheep, and for herds of cattle, and for asses; and he fed them with bread for all their cattle that year."
4504,dby,"And that year ended; and they came to him the second year, and said to him, We will not hide [it] from my lord that since [our] money is come to an end, and the herds of cattle are in the possession of my lord, nothing is left before my lord but our bodies and our land."
4505,dby,"Why should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be bondmen to Pharaoh; and give seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not desolate."
4506,dby,"And Joseph bought all the soil of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them; and the land became Pharaoh's."
4507,dby,"And as for the people, he removed them into the cities, from [one] end of the borders of Egypt even to the [other] end of it."
4508,dby,"Only the land of the priests he did not buy; for the priests had an assigned portion from Pharaoh, and ate their assigned portion which Pharaoh had given them; so they did not sell their land."
4509,dby,"And Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and sow the land."
4510,dby,"And it shall come to pass in the increase that ye shall give the fifth to Pharaoh, and the four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones."
4511,dby,"And they said, Thou hast saved us alive. Let us find favour in the eyes of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's bondmen."
4512,dby,"And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, [that] the fifth should be for Pharaoh, except the land of the priests: theirs alone did not become Pharaoh's."
4513,dby,"And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they had possessions in it, and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly."
4514,dby,"And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; and the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred and forty-seven years."
4515,dby,"And the days of Israel approached that he should die. And he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found favour in thine eyes, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt;"
4516,dby,"but when I shall lie with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their sepulchre. And he said, I will do according to thy word."
4517,dby,"And he said, Swear to me; and he swore to him. And Israel worshipped on the bed's head."
4518,dby,"And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick. And he took with him his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim."
4519,dby,"And one told Jacob and said, Behold, thy son Joseph is coming to thee. And Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed."
4520,dby,"And Jacob said to Joseph, The Almighty ÌÄå_God appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,"
4521,dby,"and he said to me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples; and will give this land to thy seed after thee [for] an everlasting possession."
4522,dby,"And now thy two sons, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came to thee into Egypt, shall be mine: Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon."
4523,dby,And thy family which thou hast begotten after them shall be thine: they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
4524,dby,"And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was yet a certain distance to come to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath, that is, Bethlehem."
4525,dby,"And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?"
4526,dby,"And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me here. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, to me, that I may bless them."
4527,dby,"But the eyes of Israel were heavy from age: he could not see. And he brought them nearer to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them."
4528,dby,"And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face; and behold, God has let me see also thy seed."
4529,dby,"And Joseph brought them out from his knees, and bowed down with his face to the earth."
4530,dby,"And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought [them] near to him."
4531,dby,"But Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid [it] on Ephraim's head -- now he was the younger -- and his left hand on Manasseh's head; guiding his hands intelligently, for Manasseh was the firstborn."
4532,dby,"And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God that shepherded me all my life long to this day,"
4533,dby,"the Angel that redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named upon them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the land!"
4534,dby,"When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it was evil in his eyes; and he took hold of his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head."
4535,dby,"And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn: put thy right hand on his head."
4536,dby,"But his father refused and said, I know, my son, I know: he also will become a people, and he also will be great; but truly his younger brother will be greater than he; and his seed will become the fulness of nations."
4537,dby,"And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee will Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and Manasseh! And he set Ephraim before Manasseh."
4538,dby,"And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die; and God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers."
4539,dby,"And *I* have given to thee one tract [of land] above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow."
4540,dby,"And Jacob called his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, and I will tell you what will befall you at the end of days."
4541,dby,"Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob, And listen to Israel your father."
4542,dby,"Reuben, thou art my firstborn, My might, and the firstfruits of my vigour: Excellency of dignity, and excellency of strength."
4543,dby,"Impetuous as the waters, thou shalt have no pre-eminence; Because thou wentest up to thy father's couch: Then defiledst thou [it]: he went up to my bed."
4544,dby,Simeon and Levi are brethren: Instruments of violence their swords.
4545,dby,"My soul, come not into their council; Mine honour, be not united with their assembly; For in their anger they slew men, And in their wantonness houghed oxen."
4546,dby,"Cursed be their anger, for it [was] violent; And their rage, for it [was] cruel! I will divide them in Jacob, And scatter them in Israel."
4547,dby,"Judah -- [as to] thee, thy brethren will praise thee; Thy hand will be upon the neck of thine enemies; Thy father's children will bow down to thee."
4548,dby,"Judah is a young lion; From the prey, my son, thou art gone up. He stoopeth, he layeth himself down as a lion, And as a lioness: who will rouse him up?"
4549,dby,"The scepter will not depart from Judah, Nor the lawgiver from between his feet, Until Shiloh come, And to him will be the obedience of peoples."
4550,dby,"He bindeth his foal to the vine, And his ass's colt to the choice vine; He washeth his dress in wine, And his garment in the blood of grapes."
4551,dby,"The eyes are red with wine, And the teeth [are] white with milk."
4552,dby,"Zebulun will dwell at the shore of the seas; Yea, he will be at the shore of the ships, And his side [toucheth] upon Sidon."
4553,dby,"Issachar is a bony ass, Crouching down between two hurdles."
4554,dby,"And he saw the rest that it was good, And the land that it was pleasant; And he bowed his shoulder to bear, And was a tributary servant."
4555,dby,"Dan will judge his people, As another of the tribes of Israel."
4556,dby,"Dan will be a serpent on the way, A horned snake on the path, Which biteth the horse's heels, So that the rider falleth backwards."
4557,dby,"I wait for thy salvation, O Jehovah."
4558,dby,Gad -- troops will rush upon him; But he will rush upon the heel.
4559,dby,"Out of Asher, his bread shall be fat, And he will give royal dainties."
4560,dby,Naphtali is a hind let loose; He giveth goodly words.
4561,dby,Joseph is a fruitful bough; A fruitful bough by a well; [His] branches shoot over the wall.
4562,dby,"The archers have provoked him, And shot at, and hated him;"
4563,dby,"But his bow abideth firm, And the arms of his hands are supple By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob. From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:"
4564,dby,"From the ÌÄå_God of thy father, and he will help thee; And from the Almighty, and he will bless thee -- With blessings of heaven from above, With blessings of the deep that lieth under, With blessings of the breast and of the womb."
4565,dby,"The blessings of thy father surpass the blessings of my ancestors, Unto the bounds of the everlasting hills: They shall be on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of him that was separated from his brethren."
4566,dby,"Benjamin -- [as] a wolf will he tear to pieces; In the morning he will devour the prey, And in the evening he will divide the booty."
4567,dby,"All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father spoke to them; and he blessed them: every one according to his blessing he blessed them."
4568,dby,"And he charged them, and said to them, I am gathered to my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,"
4569,dby,"in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is opposite to Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought of Ephron the Hittite along with the field for a possession of a sepulchre."
4570,dby,There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebecca his wife; and there I buried Leah.
4571,dby,"The purchase of the field, and of the cave that is in it, was from the children of Heth."
4572,dby,"And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered his feet into the bed, and expired, and was gathered to his peoples."
4573,dby,"And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him."
4574,dby,And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. And the physicians embalmed Israel.
4575,dby,And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those who are embalmed. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.
4576,dby,"And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found favour in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,"
4577,dby,"My father made me swear, saying, Behold, I die; in my grave which I have dug myself in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. And now, let me go up, I pray thee, that I may bury my father; and I will come again."
4578,dby,"And Pharaoh said, Go up and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear."
4579,dby,"And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the bondmen of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,"
4580,dby,"and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house; only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen."
4581,dby,And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen; and the camp was very great.
4582,dby,"And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan; and there they lamented with a great and very grievous lamentation; and he made a mourning for his father of seven days."
4583,dby,"And the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing-floor of Atad, and they said, This is a grievous mourning of the Egyptians. Therefore the name of it was called Abel-Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan."
4584,dby,And his sons did to him according as he had commanded them;
4585,dby,"and his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah which Abraham had bought along with the field, for a possession of a sepulchre, of Ephron the Hittite, opposite to Mamre."
4586,dby,"And, after he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brethren, and all that had gone up with him to bury his father."
4587,dby,"And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, If now Joseph should be hostile to us, and should indeed requite us all the evil that we did to him!"
4588,dby,"And they sent a messenger to Joseph, saying, Thy father commanded before he died, saying,"
4589,dby,"Thus shall ye speak to Joseph: Oh forgive, I pray thee, the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin! for they did evil to thee. And now, we pray thee, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him."
4590,dby,"And his brethren also went and fell down before his face, and said, Behold, we are thy bondmen."
4591,dby,"And Joseph said to them, Fear not: am I then in the place of God?"
4592,dby,"Ye indeed meant evil against me: God meant it for good, in order that he might do as [it is] this day, to save a great people alive."
4593,dby,"And now, fear not: I will maintain you and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spoke consolingly to them."
4594,dby,"And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father's house; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years."
4595,dby,And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third [generation]; the sons also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born on Joseph's knees.
4596,dby,"And Joseph said to his brethren, I die; and God will certainly visit you, and bring you up out of this land, into the land that he swore unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
4597,dby,"And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will certainly visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones hence."
4598,dby,"And Joseph died, a hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him; and he was put in a coffin in Egypt."
4599,kjv,In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
4600,kjv,"And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."
4601,kjv,"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light."
4602,kjv,"And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness."
4603,kjv,"And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day."
4604,kjv,"And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."
4605,kjv,"And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so."
4606,kjv,And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
4607,kjv,"And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so."
4608,kjv,And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
4609,kjv,"And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so."
4610,kjv,"And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good."
4611,kjv,And the evening and the morning were the third day.
4612,kjv,"And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:"
4613,kjv,And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
4614,kjv,"And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also."
4615,kjv,"And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,"
4616,kjv,"And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good."
4617,kjv,And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
4618,kjv,"And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven."
4619,kjv,"And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good."
4620,kjv,"And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth."
4621,kjv,And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
4622,kjv,"And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so."
4623,kjv,"And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good."
4624,kjv,"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."
4625,kjv,"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."
4626,kjv,"And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."
4627,kjv,"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat."
4628,kjv,"And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so."
4629,kjv,"And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day."
4630,kjv,"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them."
4631,kjv,And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
4632,kjv,"And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made."
4633,kjv,"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,"
4634,kjv,"And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground."
4635,kjv,"But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground."
4636,kjv,"And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."
4637,kjv,And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
4638,kjv,"And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil."
4639,kjv,"And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads."
4640,kjv,"The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;"
4641,kjv,And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
4642,kjv,And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
4643,kjv,And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
4644,kjv,"And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it."
4645,kjv,"And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:"
4646,kjv,"But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."
4647,kjv,"And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him."
4648,kjv,"And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof."
4649,kjv,"And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him."
4650,kjv,"And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;"
4651,kjv,"And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man."
4652,kjv,"And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."
4653,kjv,"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."
4654,kjv,"And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed."
4655,kjv,"Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?"
4656,kjv,"And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:"
4657,kjv,"But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die."
4658,kjv,"And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:"
4659,kjv,"For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."
4660,kjv,"And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat."
4661,kjv,"And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons."
4662,kjv,And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
4663,kjv,"And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?"
4664,kjv,"And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."
4665,kjv,"And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?"
4666,kjv,"And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat."
4667,kjv,"And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat."
4668,kjv,"And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:"
4669,kjv,"And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."
4670,kjv,"Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee."
4671,kjv,"And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;"
4672,kjv,Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
4673,kjv,"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return."
4674,kjv,And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
4675,kjv,"Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them."
4676,kjv,"And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:"
4677,kjv,"Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken."
4678,kjv,"So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life."
4679,kjv,"And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD."
4680,kjv,"And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground."
4681,kjv,"And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD."
4682,kjv,"And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:"
4683,kjv,"But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell."
4684,kjv,"And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?"
4685,kjv,"If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him."
4686,kjv,"And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him."
4687,kjv,"And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?"
4688,kjv,"And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground."
4689,kjv,"And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;"
4690,kjv,"When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth."
4691,kjv,"And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear."
4692,kjv,"Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me."
4693,kjv,"And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him."
4694,kjv,"And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden."
4695,kjv,"And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch."
4696,kjv,And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.
4697,kjv,"And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah."
4698,kjv,"And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle."
4699,kjv,And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
4700,kjv,"And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah."
4701,kjv,"And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt."
4702,kjv,"If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold."
4703,kjv,"And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew."
4704,kjv,"And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD."
4705,kjv,"This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;"
4706,kjv,"Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created."
4707,kjv,"And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth:"
4708,kjv,And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:
4709,kjv,And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.
4710,kjv,"And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:"
4711,kjv,"And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:"
4712,kjv,And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.
4713,kjv,"And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:"
4714,kjv,"And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:"
4715,kjv,And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died.
4716,kjv,And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel:
4717,kjv,"And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:"
4718,kjv,And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.
4719,kjv,"And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:"
4720,kjv,"And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:"
4721,kjv,And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.
4722,kjv,"And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch:"
4723,kjv,"And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:"
4724,kjv,And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.
4725,kjv,"And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:"
4726,kjv,"And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:"
4727,kjv,And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:
4728,kjv,And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.
4729,kjv,"And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech."
4730,kjv,"And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:"
4731,kjv,And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.
4732,kjv,"And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:"
4733,kjv,"And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed."
4734,kjv,"And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:"
4735,kjv,And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.
4736,kjv,"And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
4737,kjv,"And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,"
4738,kjv,That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
4739,kjv,"And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years."
4740,kjv,"There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown."
4741,kjv,"And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."
4742,kjv,"And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart."
4743,kjv,"And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them."
4744,kjv,But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
4745,kjv,"These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God."
4746,kjv,"And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
4747,kjv,"The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence."
4748,kjv,"And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth."
4749,kjv,"And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth."
4750,kjv,"Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch."
4751,kjv,"And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits."
4752,kjv,"A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it."
4753,kjv,"And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die."
4754,kjv,"But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee."
4755,kjv,"And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female."
4756,kjv,"Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive."
4757,kjv,"And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them."
4758,kjv,"Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he."
4759,kjv,"And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation."
4760,kjv,"Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female."
4761,kjv,"Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth."
4762,kjv,"For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth."
4763,kjv,And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.
4764,kjv,And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
4765,kjv,"And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood."
4766,kjv,"Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,"
4767,kjv,"There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah."
4768,kjv,"And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth."
4769,kjv,"In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened."
4770,kjv,And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
4771,kjv,"In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;"
4772,kjv,"They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort."
4773,kjv,"And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life."
4774,kjv,"And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in."
4775,kjv,"And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth."
4776,kjv,"And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters."
4777,kjv,"And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered."
4778,kjv,Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
4779,kjv,"And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:"
4780,kjv,"All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died."
4781,kjv,"And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark."
4782,kjv,And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.
4783,kjv,"And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged;"
4784,kjv,"The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;"
4785,kjv,And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
4786,kjv,"And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat."
4787,kjv,"And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen."
4788,kjv,"And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:"
4789,kjv,"And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth."
4790,kjv,"Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;"
4791,kjv,"But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark."
4792,kjv,And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
4793,kjv,"And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth."
4794,kjv,And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.
4795,kjv,"And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry."
4796,kjv,"And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried."
4797,kjv,"And God spake unto Noah, saying,"
4798,kjv,"Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee."
4799,kjv,"Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth."
4800,kjv,"And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:"
4801,kjv,"Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark."
4802,kjv,"And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar."
4803,kjv,"And the LORD smelled a sweet savor; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done."
4804,kjv,"While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."
4805,kjv,"And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth."
4806,kjv,"And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered."
4807,kjv,Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.
4808,kjv,"But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat."
4809,kjv,"And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man."
4810,kjv,"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man."
4811,kjv,"And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein."
4812,kjv,"And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,"
4813,kjv,"And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;"
4814,kjv,"And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth."
4815,kjv,"And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth."
4816,kjv,"And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:"
4817,kjv,"I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth."
4818,kjv,"And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:"
4819,kjv,"And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh."
4820,kjv,"And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth."
4821,kjv,"And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth."
4822,kjv,"And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan."
4823,kjv,These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.
4824,kjv,"And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:"
4825,kjv,"And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent."
4826,kjv,"And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without."
4827,kjv,"And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness."
4828,kjv,"And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him."
4829,kjv,"And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren."
4830,kjv,"And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant."
4831,kjv,"God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant."
4832,kjv,And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
4833,kjv,And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.
4834,kjv,"Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood."
4835,kjv,"The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras."
4836,kjv,"And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah."
4837,kjv,"And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim."
4838,kjv,"By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations."
4839,kjv,"And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan."
4840,kjv,"And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan."
4841,kjv,And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
4842,kjv,"He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD."
4843,kjv,"And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar."
4844,kjv,"Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,"
4845,kjv,And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.
4846,kjv,"And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,"
4847,kjv,"And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim."
4848,kjv,"And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,"
4849,kjv,"And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,"
4850,kjv,"And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,"
4851,kjv,"And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad."
4852,kjv,"And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha."
4853,kjv,"These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations."
4854,kjv,"Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born."
4855,kjv,"The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram."
4856,kjv,"And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash."
4857,kjv,And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.
4858,kjv,And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.
4859,kjv,"And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,"
4860,kjv,"And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,"
4861,kjv,"And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,"
4862,kjv,"And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan."
4863,kjv,"And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east."
4864,kjv,"These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations."
4865,kjv,"These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood."
4866,kjv,"And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech."
4867,kjv,"And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there."
4868,kjv,"And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar."
4869,kjv,"And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth."
4870,kjv,"And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded."
4871,kjv,"And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do."
4872,kjv,"Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech."
4873,kjv,So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.
4874,kjv,Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
4875,kjv,"These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:"
4876,kjv,"And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
4877,kjv,"And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:"
4878,kjv,"And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters."
4879,kjv,"And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:"
4880,kjv,"And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters."
4881,kjv,"And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:"
4882,kjv,"And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters."
4883,kjv,"And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:"
4884,kjv,"And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters."
4885,kjv,"And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:"
4886,kjv,"And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters."
4887,kjv,"And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:"
4888,kjv,"And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
4889,kjv,"And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:"
4890,kjv,"And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters."
4891,kjv,"And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran."
4892,kjv,"Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot."
4893,kjv,"And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees."
4894,kjv,"And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah."
4895,kjv,But Sarai was barren; she had no child.
4896,kjv,"And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there."
4897,kjv,And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
4898,kjv,"Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee:"
4899,kjv,"And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:"
4900,kjv,"And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed."
4901,kjv,"So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran."
4902,kjv,"And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came."
4903,kjv,"And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land."
4904,kjv,"And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him."
4905,kjv,"And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD."
4906,kjv,"And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south."
4907,kjv,And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
4908,kjv,"And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:"
4909,kjv,"Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive."
4910,kjv,"Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee."
4911,kjv,"And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair."
4912,kjv,"The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house."
4913,kjv,"And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels."
4914,kjv,And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.
4915,kjv,"And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?"
4916,kjv,"Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way."
4917,kjv,"And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had."
4918,kjv,"And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south."
4919,kjv,"And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold."
4920,kjv,"And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;"
4921,kjv,"Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD."
4922,kjv,"And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents."
4923,kjv,"And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together."
4924,kjv,And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.
4925,kjv,"And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren."
4926,kjv,"Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left."
4927,kjv,"And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar."
4928,kjv,Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
4929,kjv,"Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom."
4930,kjv,But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.
4931,kjv,"And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:"
4932,kjv,"For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever."
4933,kjv,"And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered."
4934,kjv,"Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee."
4935,kjv,"Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD."
4936,kjv,"And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;"
4937,kjv,"That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar."
4938,kjv,"All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea."
4939,kjv,"Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled."
4940,kjv,"And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,"
4941,kjv,"And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness."
4942,kjv,"And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar."
4943,kjv,"And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;"
4944,kjv,"With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five."
4945,kjv,"And the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain."
4946,kjv,"And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way."
4947,kjv,"And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed."
4948,kjv,"And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram."
4949,kjv,"And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan."
4950,kjv,"And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus."
4951,kjv,"And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people."
4952,kjv,"And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale."
4953,kjv,And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
4954,kjv,"And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:"
4955,kjv,"And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all."
4956,kjv,"And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself."
4957,kjv,"And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,"
4958,kjv,"That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:"
4959,kjv,"Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion."
4960,kjv,"After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward."
4961,kjv,"And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?"
4962,kjv,"And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir."
4963,kjv,"And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir."
4964,kjv,"And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be."
4965,kjv,And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
4966,kjv,"And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it."
4967,kjv,"And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?"
4968,kjv,"And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
4969,kjv,"And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not."
4970,kjv,"And when the fowls came down upon the carcasses, Abram drove them away."
4971,kjv,"And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him."
4972,kjv,"And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;"
4973,kjv,"And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance."
4974,kjv,And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
4975,kjv,But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
4976,kjv,"And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces."
4977,kjv,"In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:"
4978,kjv,"The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,"
4979,kjv,"And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaim,"
4980,kjv,"And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."
4981,kjv,"Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar."
4982,kjv,"And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai."
4983,kjv,"And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife."
4984,kjv,"And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes."
4985,kjv,"And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee."
4986,kjv,"But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face."
4987,kjv,"And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur."
4988,kjv,"And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai."
4989,kjv,"And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands."
4990,kjv,"And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude."
4991,kjv,"And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction."
4992,kjv,"And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren."
4993,kjv,"And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?"
4994,kjv,"Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered."
4995,kjv,"And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael."
4996,kjv,"And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram."
4997,kjv,"And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect."
4998,kjv,"And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly."
4999,kjv,"And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,"
5000,kjv,"As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations."
5001,kjv,"Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee."
5002,kjv,"And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee."
5003,kjv,"And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee."
5004,kjv,"And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God."
5005,kjv,"And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations."
5006,kjv,"This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised."
5007,kjv,And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.
5008,kjv,"And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed."
5009,kjv,"He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant."
5010,kjv,"And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant."
5011,kjv,"And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be."
5012,kjv,"And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her."
5013,kjv,"Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?"
5014,kjv,"And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!"
5015,kjv,"And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him."
5016,kjv,"And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation."
5017,kjv,"But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year."
5018,kjv,"And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham."
5019,kjv,"And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him."
5020,kjv,"And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin."
5021,kjv,"And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin."
5022,kjv,"In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son."
5023,kjv,"And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him."
5024,kjv,And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
5025,kjv,"And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,"
5026,kjv,"And said, My LORD, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:"
5027,kjv,"Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:"
5028,kjv,"And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said."
5029,kjv,"And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth."
5030,kjv,"And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it."
5031,kjv,"And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat."
5032,kjv,"And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent."
5033,kjv,"And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him."
5034,kjv,Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
5035,kjv,"Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?"
5036,kjv,"And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?"
5037,kjv,"Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son."
5038,kjv,"Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh."
5039,kjv,"And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way."
5040,kjv,"And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;"
5041,kjv,"Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?"
5042,kjv,"For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him."
5043,kjv,"And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;"
5044,kjv,"I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know."
5045,kjv,"And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD."
5046,kjv,"And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?"
5047,kjv,Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
5048,kjv,"That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"
5049,kjv,"And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes."
5050,kjv,"And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:"
5051,kjv,"Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it."
5052,kjv,"And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake."
5053,kjv,"And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there."
5054,kjv,"And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake."
5055,kjv,"And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake."
5056,kjv,"And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place."
5057,kjv,And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
5058,kjv,"And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night."
5059,kjv,"And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat."
5060,kjv,"But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:"
5061,kjv,"And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them."
5062,kjv,"And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,"
5063,kjv,"And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly."
5064,kjv,"Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof."
5065,kjv,"And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door."
5066,kjv,"But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door."
5067,kjv,"And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door."
5068,kjv,"And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:"
5069,kjv,"For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it."
5070,kjv,"And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law."
5071,kjv,"And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city."
5072,kjv,"And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city."
5073,kjv,"And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed."
5074,kjv,"And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:"
5075,kjv,"Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:"
5076,kjv,"Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live."
5077,kjv,"And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken."
5078,kjv,"Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar."
5079,kjv,The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
5080,kjv,Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
5081,kjv,"And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground."
5082,kjv,"But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt."
5083,kjv,And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:
5084,kjv,"And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace."
5085,kjv,"And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt."
5086,kjv,"And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters."
5087,kjv,"And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:"
5088,kjv,"Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father."
5089,kjv,"And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
5090,kjv,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father."
5091,kjv,"And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
5092,kjv,Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
5093,kjv,"And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day."
5094,kjv,"And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day."
5095,kjv,"And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar."
5096,kjv,"And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah."
5097,kjv,"But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife."
5098,kjv,"But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?"
5099,kjv,"Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this."
5100,kjv,"And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her."
5101,kjv,"Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine."
5102,kjv,"Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid."
5103,kjv,"Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done."
5104,kjv,"And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?"
5105,kjv,"And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake."
5106,kjv,"And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife."
5107,kjv,"And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother."
5108,kjv,"And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife."
5109,kjv,"And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee."
5110,kjv,"And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved."
5111,kjv,"So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children."
5112,kjv,"For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife."
5113,kjv,"And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken."
5114,kjv,"For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him."
5115,kjv,"And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac."
5116,kjv,"And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him."
5117,kjv,"And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him."
5118,kjv,"And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me."
5119,kjv,"And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age."
5120,kjv,"And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned."
5121,kjv,"And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking."
5122,kjv,"Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac."
5123,kjv,And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.
5124,kjv,"And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called."
5125,kjv,"And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed."
5126,kjv,"And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba."
5127,kjv,"And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs."
5128,kjv,"And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept."
5129,kjv,"And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is."
5130,kjv,"Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation."
5131,kjv,"And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink."
5132,kjv,"And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer."
5133,kjv,And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
5134,kjv,"And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:"
5135,kjv,"Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned."
5136,kjv,"And Abraham said, I will swear."
5137,kjv,"And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away."
5138,kjv,"And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day."
5139,kjv,"And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant."
5140,kjv,And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
5141,kjv,"And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?"
5142,kjv,"And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well."
5143,kjv,Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them.
5144,kjv,"Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines."
5145,kjv,"And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God."
5146,kjv,And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.
5147,kjv,"And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am."
5148,kjv,"And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of."
5149,kjv,"And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him."
5150,kjv,"Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off."
5151,kjv,"And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you."
5152,kjv,"And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together."
5153,kjv,"And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"
5154,kjv,"And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together."
5155,kjv,"And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood."
5156,kjv,"And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son."
5157,kjv,"And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I."
5158,kjv,"And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me."
5159,kjv,"And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son."
5160,kjv,"And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen."
5161,kjv,"And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,"
5162,kjv,"And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:"
5163,kjv,"That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;"
5164,kjv,And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
5165,kjv,"So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba."
5166,kjv,"And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;"
5167,kjv,"Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,"
5168,kjv,"And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
5169,kjv,"And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother."
5170,kjv,"And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah."
5171,kjv,And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.
5172,kjv,"And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her."
5173,kjv,"And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,"
5174,kjv,"I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
5175,kjv,"And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,"
5176,kjv,"Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead."
5177,kjv,"And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth."
5178,kjv,"And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,"
5179,kjv,"That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you."
5180,kjv,"And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,"
5181,kjv,"Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead."
5182,kjv,And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.
5183,kjv,"And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there."
5184,kjv,"And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,"
5185,kjv,"My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead."
5186,kjv,"And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant."
5187,kjv,"And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure"
5188,kjv,"Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city."
5189,kjv,"And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan."
5190,kjv,"And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth."
5191,kjv,"And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things."
5192,kjv,"And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:"
5193,kjv,"And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:"
5194,kjv,"But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac."
5195,kjv,"And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?"
5196,kjv,"And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again."
5197,kjv,"The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence."
5198,kjv,"And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again."
5199,kjv,"And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter."
5200,kjv,"And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor."
5201,kjv,"And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water."
5202,kjv,"And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master Abraham."
5203,kjv,"Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:"
5204,kjv,"And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast showed kindness unto my master."
5205,kjv,"And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder."
5206,kjv,"And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up."
5207,kjv,"And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher."
5208,kjv,"And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink."
5209,kjv,"And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking."
5210,kjv,"And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels."
5211,kjv,"And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not."
5212,kjv,"And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;"
5213,kjv,"And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?"
5214,kjv,"And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor."
5215,kjv,"She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in."
5216,kjv,"And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD."
5217,kjv,"And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren."
5218,kjv,"And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things."
5219,kjv,"And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well."
5220,kjv,"And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well."
5221,kjv,"And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels."
5222,kjv,"And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him."
5223,kjv,"And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on."
5224,kjv,"And he said, I am Abraham's servant."
5225,kjv,"And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses."
5226,kjv,And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.
5227,kjv,"And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:"
5228,kjv,"But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son."
5229,kjv,"And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me."
5230,kjv,"And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:"
5231,kjv,"Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath."
5232,kjv,"And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:"
5233,kjv,"Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;"
5234,kjv,"And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's son."
5235,kjv,"And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee."
5236,kjv,"And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also."
5237,kjv,"And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands."
5238,kjv,"And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son."
5239,kjv,"And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left."
5240,kjv,"Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good."
5241,kjv,"Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken."
5242,kjv,"And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth."
5243,kjv,"And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things."
5244,kjv,"And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master."
5245,kjv,"And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go."
5246,kjv,"And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master."
5247,kjv,"And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth."
5248,kjv,"And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go."
5249,kjv,"And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men."
5250,kjv,"And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them."
5251,kjv,"And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way."
5252,kjv,And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country.
5253,kjv,"And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming."
5254,kjv,"And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel."
5255,kjv,"For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself."
5256,kjv,And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
5257,kjv,"And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death."
5258,kjv,"Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah."
5259,kjv,"And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah."
5260,kjv,"And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim."
5261,kjv,"And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah."
5262,kjv,And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
5263,kjv,"But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country."
5264,kjv,"And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years."
5265,kjv,"Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people."
5266,kjv,"And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;"
5267,kjv,"The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife."
5268,kjv,"And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi."
5269,kjv,"Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:"
5270,kjv,"And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,"
5271,kjv,"And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,"
5272,kjv,"Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:"
5273,kjv,"These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations."
5274,kjv,"And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people."
5275,kjv,"And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren."
5276,kjv,"And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:"
5277,kjv,"And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian."
5278,kjv,"And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived."
5279,kjv,"And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of the LORD."
5280,kjv,"And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger."
5281,kjv,"And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb."
5282,kjv,"And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau."
5283,kjv,"And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them."
5284,kjv,"And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents."
5285,kjv,"And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob."
5286,kjv,"And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:"
5287,kjv,"And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom."
5288,kjv,"And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright."
5289,kjv,"And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?"
5290,kjv,"And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob."
5291,kjv,"Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright."
5292,kjv,"And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar."
5293,kjv,"And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:"
5294,kjv,"Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;"
5295,kjv,"And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;"
5296,kjv,"Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
5297,kjv,And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:
5298,kjv,"And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon."
5299,kjv,"And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife."
5300,kjv,"And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her."
5301,kjv,"And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us."
5302,kjv,"And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death."
5303,kjv,"Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him."
5304,kjv,"And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:"
5305,kjv,"For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him."
5306,kjv,"For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth."
5307,kjv,"And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we."
5308,kjv,"And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there."
5309,kjv,"And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them."
5310,kjv,"And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water."
5311,kjv,"And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him."
5312,kjv,"And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah."
5313,kjv,"And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land."
5314,kjv,And he went up from thence to Beersheba.
5315,kjv,"And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake."
5316,kjv,"And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well."
5317,kjv,"Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army."
5318,kjv,"And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?"
5319,kjv,"And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;"
5320,kjv,"That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD."
5321,kjv,"And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink."
5322,kjv,"And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace."
5323,kjv,"And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water."
5324,kjv,And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day.
5325,kjv,"And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:"
5326,kjv,Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
5327,kjv,"And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I."
5328,kjv,"And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:"
5329,kjv,"Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;"
5330,kjv,"And make me savory meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die."
5331,kjv,"And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it."
5332,kjv,"And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,"
5333,kjv,"Bring me venison, and make me savory meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death."
5334,kjv,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee."
5335,kjv,"Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savory meat for thy father, such as he loveth:"
5336,kjv,"And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death."
5337,kjv,"And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:"
5338,kjv,"My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing."
5339,kjv,"And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them."
5340,kjv,"And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savory meat, such as his father loved."
5341,kjv,"And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:"
5342,kjv,"And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:"
5343,kjv,"And she gave the savory meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob."
5344,kjv,"And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?"
5345,kjv,"And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me."
5346,kjv,"And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me."
5347,kjv,"And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not."
5348,kjv,"And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
5349,kjv,"And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him."
5350,kjv,"And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am."
5351,kjv,"And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank."
5352,kjv,"And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son."
5353,kjv,"And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:"
5354,kjv,"Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:"
5355,kjv,"Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee."
5356,kjv,"And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting."
5357,kjv,"And he also had made savory meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me."
5358,kjv,"And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau."
5359,kjv,"And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed."
5360,kjv,"And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father."
5361,kjv,"And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing."
5362,kjv,"And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?"
5363,kjv,"And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?"
5364,kjv,"And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept."
5365,kjv,"And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;"
5366,kjv,"And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck."
5367,kjv,"And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob."
5368,kjv,"And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee."
5369,kjv,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;"
5370,kjv,"And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away;"
5371,kjv,"Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?"
5372,kjv,"And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?"
5373,kjv,"And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan."
5374,kjv,"Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother."
5375,kjv,"And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;"
5376,kjv,"And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham."
5377,kjv,"And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother."
5378,kjv,"When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;"
5379,kjv,"And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram;"
5380,kjv,And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;
5381,kjv,"Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife."
5382,kjv,"And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran."
5383,kjv,"And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep."
5384,kjv,"And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it."
5385,kjv,"And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;"
5386,kjv,"And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
5387,kjv,"And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of."
5388,kjv,"And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not."
5389,kjv,"And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."
5390,kjv,"And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it."
5391,kjv,And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.
5392,kjv,"And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,"
5393,kjv,So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:
5394,kjv,"And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee."
5395,kjv,"Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east."
5396,kjv,"And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth."
5397,kjv,"And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place."
5398,kjv,"And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we."
5399,kjv,"And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him."
5400,kjv,"And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep."
5401,kjv,"And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them."
5402,kjv,"And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep."
5403,kjv,"And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she kept them."
5404,kjv,"And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother."
5405,kjv,"And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept."
5406,kjv,"And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father."
5407,kjv,"And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things."
5408,kjv,"And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month."
5409,kjv,"And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?"
5410,kjv,"And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel."
5411,kjv,Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favored.
5412,kjv,"And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter."
5413,kjv,"And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me."
5414,kjv,"And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her."
5415,kjv,"And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her."
5416,kjv,"And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast."
5417,kjv,"And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her."
5418,kjv,And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.
5419,kjv,"And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?"
5420,kjv,"And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn."
5421,kjv,"Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years."
5422,kjv,"And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also."
5423,kjv,And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.
5424,kjv,"And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years."
5425,kjv,"And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren."
5426,kjv,"And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me."
5427,kjv,"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon."
5428,kjv,"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi."
5429,kjv,"And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing."
5430,kjv,"And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die."
5431,kjv,"And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?"
5432,kjv,"And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her."
5433,kjv,And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.
5434,kjv,"And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son."
5435,kjv,"And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan."
5436,kjv,"And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son."
5437,kjv,"And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali."
5438,kjv,"When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife."
5439,kjv,And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.
5440,kjv,"And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad."
5441,kjv,And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.
5442,kjv,"And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher."
5443,kjv,"And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes."
5444,kjv,"And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes."
5445,kjv,"And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night."
5446,kjv,"And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son."
5447,kjv,"And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar."
5448,kjv,"And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son."
5449,kjv,"And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun."
5450,kjv,"And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah."
5451,kjv,"And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb."
5452,kjv,"And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:"
5453,kjv,"And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son."
5454,kjv,"And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country."
5455,kjv,"Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee."
5456,kjv,"And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake."
5457,kjv,"And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it."
5458,kjv,"And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me."
5459,kjv,"For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?"
5460,kjv,"And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock."
5461,kjv,"I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire."
5462,kjv,"So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me."
5463,kjv,"And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word."
5464,kjv,"And he removed that day the he goats that were ring-streaked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons."
5465,kjv,And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
5466,kjv,"And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chestnut tree; and pilled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods."
5467,kjv,"And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink."
5468,kjv,"And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ring-streaked, speckled, and spotted."
5469,kjv,"And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ring-streaked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle."
5470,kjv,"And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods."
5471,kjv,"But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's."
5472,kjv,"And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses."
5473,kjv,"And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory."
5474,kjv,"And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before."
5475,kjv,"And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee."
5476,kjv,"And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,"
5477,kjv,"And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me."
5478,kjv,And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
5479,kjv,"And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me."
5480,kjv,"If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ring-streaked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ring-streaked."
5481,kjv,"Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me."
5482,kjv,"And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled."
5483,kjv,"And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I."
5484,kjv,"And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee."
5485,kjv,"I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred."
5486,kjv,"And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?"
5487,kjv,"Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money."
5488,kjv,"For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do."
5489,kjv,"Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;"
5490,kjv,"And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan."
5491,kjv,And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.
5492,kjv,"And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled."
5493,kjv,"So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead."
5494,kjv,And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
5495,kjv,"And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead."
5496,kjv,"And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
5497,kjv,Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.
5498,kjv,"And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?"
5499,kjv,"Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?"
5500,kjv,And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.
5501,kjv,"It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
5502,kjv,"And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?"
5503,kjv,"And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me."
5504,kjv,"With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them."
5505,kjv,"And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent."
5506,kjv,"Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not."
5507,kjv,"And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched but found not the images."
5508,kjv,"And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?"
5509,kjv,"Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both."
5510,kjv,"This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten."
5511,kjv,"That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night."
5512,kjv,"Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes."
5513,kjv,"Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times."
5514,kjv,"Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight."
5515,kjv,"And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?"
5516,kjv,"Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee."
5517,kjv,"And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar."
5518,kjv,"And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap."
5519,kjv,And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.
5520,kjv,"And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;"
5521,kjv,"And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another."
5522,kjv,"If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee."
5523,kjv,"And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:"
5524,kjv,"This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm."
5525,kjv,"The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac."
5526,kjv,"Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount."
5527,kjv,"And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place."
5528,kjv,"And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him."
5529,kjv,"And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim."
5530,kjv,"And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom."
5531,kjv,"And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:"
5532,kjv,"And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight."
5533,kjv,"And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him."
5534,kjv,"Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;"
5535,kjv,"And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape."
5536,kjv,"And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:"
5537,kjv,"I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands."
5538,kjv,"Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children."
5539,kjv,"And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude."
5540,kjv,And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;
5541,kjv,"Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,"
5542,kjv,"Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals."
5543,kjv,"And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove."
5544,kjv,"And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?"
5545,kjv,"Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us."
5546,kjv,"And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him."
5547,kjv,"And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me."
5548,kjv,So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.
5549,kjv,"And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok."
5550,kjv,"And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had."
5551,kjv,And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
5552,kjv,"And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him."
5553,kjv,"And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me."
5554,kjv,"And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob."
5555,kjv,"And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed."
5556,kjv,"And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there."
5557,kjv,"And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved."
5558,kjv,"And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh."
5559,kjv,"Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank."
5560,kjv,"And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids."
5561,kjv,"And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost."
5562,kjv,"And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother."
5563,kjv,"And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept."
5564,kjv,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant."
5565,kjv,"Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves."
5566,kjv,"And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves."
5567,kjv,"And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord."
5568,kjv,"And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself."
5569,kjv,"And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me."
5570,kjv,"Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it."
5571,kjv,"And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee."
5572,kjv,"And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die."
5573,kjv,"Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir."
5574,kjv,"And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord."
5575,kjv,So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
5576,kjv,"And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth."
5577,kjv,"And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city."
5578,kjv,"And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money."
5579,kjv,"And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael."
5580,kjv,"And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land."
5581,kjv,"And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her."
5582,kjv,"And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel."
5583,kjv,"And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife."
5584,kjv,And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.
5585,kjv,And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.
5586,kjv,"And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done."
5587,kjv,"And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife."
5588,kjv,"And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you."
5589,kjv,"And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein."
5590,kjv,"And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give."
5591,kjv,"Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife."
5592,kjv,"And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:"
5593,kjv,"And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:"
5594,kjv,"But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;"
5595,kjv,"Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people."
5596,kjv,"But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone."
5597,kjv,"And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son."
5598,kjv,"And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honorable than all the house of his father."
5599,kjv,"And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,"
5600,kjv,"These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters."
5601,kjv,"Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised."
5602,kjv,"Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us."
5603,kjv,"And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city."
5604,kjv,"And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males."
5605,kjv,"And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out."
5606,kjv,"The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister."
5607,kjv,"They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,"
5608,kjv,"And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house."
5609,kjv,"And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house."
5610,kjv,"And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?"
5611,kjv,"And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother."
5612,kjv,"Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:"
5613,kjv,"And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went."
5614,kjv,"And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem."
5615,kjv,"And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob."
5616,kjv,"So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him."
5617,kjv,"And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother."
5618,kjv,"But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth."
5619,kjv,"And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him."
5620,kjv,"And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel."
5621,kjv,"And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;"
5622,kjv,"And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land."
5623,kjv,And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.
5624,kjv,"And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon."
5625,kjv,"And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel."
5626,kjv,"And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor."
5627,kjv,"And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also."
5628,kjv,"And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin."
5629,kjv,"And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem."
5630,kjv,And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.
5631,kjv,"And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar."
5632,kjv,"And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:"
5633,kjv,"The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:"
5634,kjv,"The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:"
5635,kjv,"And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:"
5636,kjv,"And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram."
5637,kjv,"And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arba, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned."
5638,kjv,And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.
5639,kjv,"And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him."
5640,kjv,"Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom."
5641,kjv,"Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;"
5642,kjv,"And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth."
5643,kjv,And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;
5644,kjv,"And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan."
5645,kjv,"And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob."
5646,kjv,For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.
5647,kjv,Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.
5648,kjv,And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:
5649,kjv,"These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau."
5650,kjv,"And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz."
5651,kjv,And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.
5652,kjv,"And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife."
5653,kjv,"And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah."
5654,kjv,"These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,"
5655,kjv,"Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah."
5656,kjv,"And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife."
5657,kjv,"And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife."
5658,kjv,"These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes."
5659,kjv,"These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,"
5660,kjv,"And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom."
5661,kjv,And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna.
5662,kjv,"And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam."
5663,kjv,"And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father."
5664,kjv,"And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah."
5665,kjv,"And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran."
5666,kjv,"The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan."
5667,kjv,"The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran."
5668,kjv,"These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,"
5669,kjv,"Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir."
5670,kjv,"And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel."
5671,kjv,And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah.
5672,kjv,"And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead."
5673,kjv,"And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead."
5674,kjv,"And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith."
5675,kjv,"And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead."
5676,kjv,"And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead."
5677,kjv,"And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead."
5678,kjv,"And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab."
5679,kjv,"And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,"
5680,kjv,"Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,"
5681,kjv,"Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,"
5682,kjv,"Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites."
5683,kjv,"And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan."
5684,kjv,"These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report."
5685,kjv,"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors."
5686,kjv,"And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him."
5687,kjv,"And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more."
5688,kjv,"And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:"
5689,kjv,"For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf."
5690,kjv,"And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words."
5691,kjv,"And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me."
5692,kjv,"And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?"
5693,kjv,And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
5694,kjv,And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
5695,kjv,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I."
5696,kjv,"And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem."
5697,kjv,"And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?"
5698,kjv,"And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks."
5699,kjv,"And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan."
5700,kjv,"And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him."
5701,kjv,"And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh."
5702,kjv,"Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams."
5703,kjv,"And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him."
5704,kjv,"And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again."
5705,kjv,"And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stripped Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colors that was on him;"
5706,kjv,"And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it."
5707,kjv,"And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt."
5708,kjv,"And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?"
5709,kjv,"Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content."
5710,kjv,"Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt."
5711,kjv,"And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes."
5712,kjv,"And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?"
5713,kjv,"And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;"
5714,kjv,"And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no."
5715,kjv,"And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces."
5716,kjv,"And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days."
5717,kjv,"And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him."
5718,kjv,"And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard."
5719,kjv,"And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah."
5720,kjv,"And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her."
5721,kjv,"And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er."
5722,kjv,"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan."
5723,kjv,"And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him."
5724,kjv,"And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar."
5725,kjv,"And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him."
5726,kjv,"And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother."
5727,kjv,"And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother."
5728,kjv,And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.
5729,kjv,"Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house."
5730,kjv,"And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite."
5731,kjv,"And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep."
5732,kjv,"And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife."
5733,kjv,"When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face."
5734,kjv,"And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?"
5735,kjv,"And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?"
5736,kjv,"And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him."
5737,kjv,"And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood."
5738,kjv,"And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not."
5739,kjv,"Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place."
5740,kjv,"And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place."
5741,kjv,"And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her."
5742,kjv,"And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt."
5743,kjv,"When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff."
5744,kjv,"And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more."
5745,kjv,"And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb."
5746,kjv,"And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first."
5747,kjv,"And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez."
5748,kjv,"And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah."
5749,kjv,"And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites, which had brought him down thither."
5750,kjv,"And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian."
5751,kjv,"And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand."
5752,kjv,"And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand."
5753,kjv,"And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field."
5754,kjv,"And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favored."
5755,kjv,"And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me."
5756,kjv,"But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;"
5757,kjv,"There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"
5758,kjv,"And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her."
5759,kjv,"And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within."
5760,kjv,"And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out."
5761,kjv,"And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,"
5762,kjv,"That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:"
5763,kjv,"And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out."
5764,kjv,"And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home."
5765,kjv,"And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:"
5766,kjv,"And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out."
5767,kjv,"And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled."
5768,kjv,"And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison."
5769,kjv,"But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison."
5770,kjv,"And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it."
5771,kjv,"The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper."
5772,kjv,"And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt."
5773,kjv,"And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers."
5774,kjv,"And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound."
5775,kjv,"And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward."
5776,kjv,"And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison."
5777,kjv,"And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad."
5778,kjv,"And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?"
5779,kjv,"And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you."
5780,kjv,"And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;"
5781,kjv,"And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:"
5782,kjv,"And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand."
5783,kjv,"And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:"
5784,kjv,"Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler."
5785,kjv,"But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:"
5786,kjv,For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
5787,kjv,"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:"
5788,kjv,And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.
5789,kjv,"And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:"
5790,kjv,"Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee."
5791,kjv,"And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants."
5792,kjv,And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:
5793,kjv,But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
5794,kjv,"Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him."
5795,kjv,"And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river."
5796,kjv,"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favored kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow."
5797,kjv,"And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favored and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river."
5798,kjv,And the ill favored and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favored and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
5799,kjv,"And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good."
5800,kjv,"And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them."
5801,kjv,"And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream."
5802,kjv,"And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh."
5803,kjv,"Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:"
5804,kjv,"Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:"
5805,kjv,"And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream."
5806,kjv,"And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret."
5807,kjv,"And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged."
5808,kjv,"Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh."
5809,kjv,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it."
5810,kjv,"And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace."
5811,kjv,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:"
5812,kjv,"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favored; and they fed in a meadow:"
5813,kjv,"And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favored and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:"
5814,kjv,And the lean and the ill favored kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
5815,kjv,"And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke."
5816,kjv,"And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:"
5817,kjv,"And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:"
5818,kjv,And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.
5819,kjv,"And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath showed Pharaoh what he is about to do."
5820,kjv,The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.
5821,kjv,And the seven thin and ill favored kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
5822,kjv,This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he showeth unto Pharaoh.
5823,kjv,"Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:"
5824,kjv,And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
5825,kjv,And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.
5826,kjv,"And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass."
5827,kjv,"Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt."
5828,kjv,"Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years."
5829,kjv,"And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities."
5830,kjv,"And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine."
5831,kjv,"And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants."
5832,kjv,"And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?"
5833,kjv,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath showed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:"
5834,kjv,"Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou."
5835,kjv,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt."
5836,kjv,"And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;"
5837,kjv,"And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt."
5838,kjv,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt."
5839,kjv,And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.
5840,kjv,"And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt."
5841,kjv,And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
5842,kjv,"And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same."
5843,kjv,"And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number."
5844,kjv,"And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him."
5845,kjv,"And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house."
5846,kjv,And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
5847,kjv,"And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended."
5848,kjv,"And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread."
5849,kjv,"And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do."
5850,kjv,"And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt."
5851,kjv,And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.
5852,kjv,"Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?"
5853,kjv,"And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die."
5854,kjv,And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
5855,kjv,"But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him."
5856,kjv,And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
5857,kjv,"And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth."
5858,kjv,"And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food."
5859,kjv,"And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him."
5860,kjv,"And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come."
5861,kjv,"And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come."
5862,kjv,"We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies."
5863,kjv,"And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come."
5864,kjv,"And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not."
5865,kjv,"And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:"
5866,kjv,"Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither."
5867,kjv,"Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies."
5868,kjv,And he put them all together into ward three days.
5869,kjv,"And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:"
5870,kjv,"If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:"
5871,kjv,"But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so."
5872,kjv,"And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us."
5873,kjv,"And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required."
5874,kjv,And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.
5875,kjv,"And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes."
5876,kjv,"Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them."
5877,kjv,"And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence."
5878,kjv,"And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth."
5879,kjv,"And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?"
5880,kjv,"And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,"
5881,kjv,"The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country."
5882,kjv,"And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:"
5883,kjv,"We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan."
5884,kjv,"And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:"
5885,kjv,"And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffic in the land."
5886,kjv,"And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid."
5887,kjv,"And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me."
5888,kjv,"And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again."
5889,kjv,"And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."
5890,kjv,And the famine was sore in the land.
5891,kjv,"And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food."
5892,kjv,"And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you."
5893,kjv,"If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:"
5894,kjv,"But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you."
5895,kjv,"And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?"
5896,kjv,"And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?"
5897,kjv,"And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones."
5898,kjv,"I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:"
5899,kjv,"For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time."
5900,kjv,"And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:"
5901,kjv,"And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:"
5902,kjv,"Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:"
5903,kjv,"And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."
5904,kjv,"And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph."
5905,kjv,"And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon."
5906,kjv,And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
5907,kjv,"And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses."
5908,kjv,"And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,"
5909,kjv,"And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:"
5910,kjv,"And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand."
5911,kjv,And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.
5912,kjv,"And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them."
5913,kjv,"And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender."
5914,kjv,And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
5915,kjv,"And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth."
5916,kjv,"And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?"
5917,kjv,"And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance."
5918,kjv,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son."
5919,kjv,"And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there."
5920,kjv,"And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread."
5921,kjv,"And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians."
5922,kjv,"And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marveled one at another."
5923,kjv,"And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him."
5924,kjv,"And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth."
5925,kjv,"And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken."
5926,kjv,"As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses."
5927,kjv,"And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?"
5928,kjv,"Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing."
5929,kjv,"And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words."
5930,kjv,"And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:"
5931,kjv,"Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?"
5932,kjv,"With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen."
5933,kjv,"And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless."
5934,kjv,"Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack."
5935,kjv,"And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack."
5936,kjv,"Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city."
5937,kjv,And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.
5938,kjv,"And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?"
5939,kjv,"And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found."
5940,kjv,"And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father."
5941,kjv,"Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh."
5942,kjv,"My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?"
5943,kjv,"And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him."
5944,kjv,"And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him."
5945,kjv,"And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die."
5946,kjv,"And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more."
5947,kjv,"And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord."
5948,kjv,"And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food."
5949,kjv,"And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us."
5950,kjv,"And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:"
5951,kjv,"And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:"
5952,kjv,"And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."
5953,kjv,"Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;"
5954,kjv,"It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave."
5955,kjv,"For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever."
5956,kjv,"Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren."
5957,kjv,"For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father."
5958,kjv,"Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren."
5959,kjv,And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
5960,kjv,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence."
5961,kjv,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt."
5962,kjv,"Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life."
5963,kjv,"For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest."
5964,kjv,"And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance."
5965,kjv,"So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt."
5966,kjv,"Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:"
5967,kjv,"And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:"
5968,kjv,"And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty."
5969,kjv,"And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you."
5970,kjv,"And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither."
5971,kjv,"And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck."
5972,kjv,"Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him."
5973,kjv,"And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants."
5974,kjv,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;"
5975,kjv,"And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land."
5976,kjv,"Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come."
5977,kjv,Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.
5978,kjv,"And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way."
5979,kjv,"To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment."
5980,kjv,"And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way."
5981,kjv,"So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way."
5982,kjv,"And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,"
5983,kjv,"And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not."
5984,kjv,"And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:"
5985,kjv,"And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die."
5986,kjv,"And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac."
5987,kjv,"And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I."
5988,kjv,"And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:"
5989,kjv,I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
5990,kjv,"And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him."
5991,kjv,"And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:"
5992,kjv,"His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt."
5993,kjv,"And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn."
5994,kjv,"And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi."
5995,kjv,"And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman."
5996,kjv,"And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
5997,kjv,"And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul."
5998,kjv,"And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron."
5999,kjv,"And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel."
6000,kjv,"These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three."
6001,kjv,"And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli."
6002,kjv,"And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel."
6003,kjv,"These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls."
6004,kjv,"The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin."
6005,kjv,"And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him."
6006,kjv,"And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard."
6007,kjv,"These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen."
6008,kjv,And the sons of Dan; Hushim.
6009,kjv,"And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem."
6010,kjv,"These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven."
6011,kjv,"All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six;"
6012,kjv,"And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten."
6013,kjv,"And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen."
6014,kjv,"And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while."
6015,kjv,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive."
6016,kjv,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and show Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;"
6017,kjv,"And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have."
6018,kjv,"And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?"
6019,kjv,"That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians."
6020,kjv,"Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen."
6021,kjv,"And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh."
6022,kjv,"And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers."
6023,kjv,"They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen."
6024,kjv,"And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:"
6025,kjv,"The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle."
6026,kjv,"And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh."
6027,kjv,"And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?"
6028,kjv,"And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage."
6029,kjv,"And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh."
6030,kjv,"And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded."
6031,kjv,"And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families."
6032,kjv,"And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine."
6033,kjv,"And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house."
6034,kjv,"And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth."
6035,kjv,"And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail."
6036,kjv,"And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year."
6037,kjv,"When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:"
6038,kjv,"Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate."
6039,kjv,"And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's."
6040,kjv,"And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof."
6041,kjv,"Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands."
6042,kjv,"Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land."
6043,kjv,"And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones."
6044,kjv,"And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants."
6045,kjv,"And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's."
6046,kjv,"And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly."
6047,kjv,And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.
6048,kjv,"And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:"
6049,kjv,"But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said."
6050,kjv,"And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head."
6051,kjv,"And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim."
6052,kjv,"And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed."
6053,kjv,"And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,"
6054,kjv,"And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession."
6055,kjv,"And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine."
6056,kjv,"And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance."
6057,kjv,"And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem."
6058,kjv,"And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?"
6059,kjv,"And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them."
6060,kjv,"Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them."
6061,kjv,"And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath showed me also thy seed."
6062,kjv,"And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth."
6063,kjv,"And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him."
6064,kjv,"And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn."
6065,kjv,"And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,"
6066,kjv,"The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."
6067,kjv,"And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head."
6068,kjv,"And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head."
6069,kjv,"And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations."
6070,kjv,"And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh."
6071,kjv,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers."
6072,kjv,"Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow."
6073,kjv,"And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days."
6074,kjv,"Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father."
6075,kjv,"Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:"
6076,kjv,"Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch."
6077,kjv,Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.
6078,kjv,"O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honor, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they digged down a wall."
6079,kjv,"Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel."
6080,kjv,"Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee."
6081,kjv,"Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?"
6082,kjv,"The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be."
6083,kjv,"Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:"
6084,kjv,"His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk."
6085,kjv,Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.
6086,kjv,Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:
6087,kjv,"And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute."
6088,kjv,"Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel."
6089,kjv,"Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward."
6090,kjv,"I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD."
6091,kjv,"Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last."
6092,kjv,"Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties."
6093,kjv,Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.
6094,kjv,"Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:"
6095,kjv,"The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:"
6096,kjv,"But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)"
6097,kjv,"Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:"
6098,kjv,"The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren."
6099,kjv,"Benjamin shall raven as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil."
6100,kjv,"All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them."
6101,kjv,"And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,"
6102,kjv,"In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace."
6103,kjv,There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.
6104,kjv,The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.
6105,kjv,"And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people."
6106,kjv,"And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him."
6107,kjv,And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
6108,kjv,And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.
6109,kjv,"And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,"
6110,kjv,"My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again."
6111,kjv,"And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear."
6112,kjv,"And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,"
6113,kjv,"And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen."
6114,kjv,And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
6115,kjv,"And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days."
6116,kjv,"And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan."
6117,kjv,And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:
6118,kjv,"For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre."
6119,kjv,"And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father."
6120,kjv,"And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him."
6121,kjv,"And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,"
6122,kjv,"So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him."
6123,kjv,"And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants."
6124,kjv,"And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?"
6125,kjv,"But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive."
6126,kjv,"Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them."
6127,kjv,"And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years."
6128,kjv,And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.
6129,kjv,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
6130,kjv,"And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence."
6131,kjv,"So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt."
6132,wbt,In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
6133,wbt,"And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."
6134,wbt,"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light."
6135,wbt,"And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness."
6136,wbt,"And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night: and the evening and the morning were the first day."
6137,wbt,"And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."
6138,wbt,And God made the firmament; and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
6139,wbt,And God called the firmament Heaven: and the evening and the morning were the second day.
6140,wbt,"And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so."
6141,wbt,"And God called the dry land Earth, and the collection of waters he called Seas: and God saw that it was good."
6142,wbt,"And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit after its kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so."
6143,wbt,"And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after its kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after its kind: and God saw that it was good."
6144,wbt,And the evening and the morning were the third day.
6145,wbt,"And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night: and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years."
6146,wbt,"And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth: and it was so."
6147,wbt,"And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also."
6148,wbt,"And God set them in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth."
6149,wbt,"And to rule over the day, and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good."
6150,wbt,And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
6151,wbt,"And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven."
6152,wbt,"And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good."
6153,wbt,"And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth."
6154,wbt,And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
6155,wbt,"And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and the creeping animal, and the beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so."
6156,wbt,"And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every animal that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good."
6157,wbt,"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth."
6158,wbt,"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."
6159,wbt,"And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living animal that moveth upon the earth."
6160,wbt,"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food."
6161,wbt,"And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every animal that creepeth upon the earth, in which is life, I have given every green herb for food: and it was so."
6162,wbt,"And God saw every thing that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day."
6163,wbt,"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them."
6164,wbt,And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
6165,wbt,"And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made."
6166,wbt,"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens."
6167,wbt,"And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground."
6168,wbt,"But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground."
6169,wbt,"And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."
6170,wbt,And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
6171,wbt,"And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil."
6172,wbt,"And a river went out of Eden to water the garden: and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads."
6173,wbt,"The name of the first is Pison, which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;"
6174,wbt,And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx-stone.
6175,wbt,And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same that compasseth the whole land of Cush.
6176,wbt,And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: which floweth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
6177,wbt,"And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it."
6178,wbt,"And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:"
6179,wbt,"But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt surely die."
6180,wbt,"And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone: I will make him a help meet for him."
6181,wbt,"And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them; and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was its name."
6182,wbt,"And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowls of the air, and to every beast of the field: but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him."
6183,wbt,"And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place."
6184,wbt,"And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, he made woman, and brought her to the man."
6185,wbt,"And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man."
6186,wbt,"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be one flesh."
6187,wbt,"And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed."
6188,wbt,"Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made: and he said to the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?"
6189,wbt,"And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:"
6190,wbt,"But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die."
6191,wbt,"And the serpent said to the woman, Ye shall not surely die:"
6192,wbt,"For God doth know, that in the day ye eat of it, then your eyes shall be opened: and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."
6193,wbt,"And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise; she took of its fruit, and ate, and gave also to her husband with her, and he ate."
6194,wbt,"And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked: and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made for themselves aprons."
6195,wbt,And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
6196,wbt,"And the LORD God called to Adam, and said to him, Where art thou?"
6197,wbt,"And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden: and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."
6198,wbt,"And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, that thou shouldest not eat?"
6199,wbt,"And the man said, The woman, whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate."
6200,wbt,"And the LORD God said to the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I ate."
6201,wbt,"And the LORD God said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field: upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:"
6202,wbt,"And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."
6203,wbt,"To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children: and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee."
6204,wbt,"And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;"
6205,wbt,Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
6206,wbt,"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou shalt return to the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and to dust shalt thou return."
6207,wbt,"And Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living."
6208,wbt,"For Adam also and for his wife the LORD God made coats of skins, and clothed them."
6209,wbt,"And the LORD God said, Behold, the man hath become as one of us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:"
6210,wbt,"Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken."
6211,wbt,"So he drove out the man: and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life."
6212,wbt,"And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD."
6213,wbt,"And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground."
6214,wbt,"And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the LORD."
6215,wbt,"And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect to Abel, and to his offering:"
6216,wbt,"But to Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell."
6217,wbt,"And the LORD said to Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?"
6218,wbt,"If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And to thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him."
6219,wbt,"And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him."
6220,wbt,"And the LORD said to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?"
6221,wbt,"And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from the ground."
6222,wbt,"And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;"
6223,wbt,"When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield to thee its strength: A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth."
6224,wbt,"And Cain said to the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear."
6225,wbt,"Behold, thou hast driven me this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it will come to pass, that every one that findeth me will slay me."
6226,wbt,"And the LORD said to him, Therefore whoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him seven-fold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him."
6227,wbt,"And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden."
6228,wbt,"And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bore Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son Enoch."
6229,wbt,And to Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.
6230,wbt,"And Lamech took to him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah."
6231,wbt,"And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle."
6232,wbt,And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
6233,wbt,"And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah."
6234,wbt,"And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt."
6235,wbt,"If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold, truly Lamech seventy and seven-fold."
6236,wbt,"And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew."
6237,wbt,"And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD."
6238,wbt,"This is the book of the generations of Adam: In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him:"
6239,wbt,"Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created."
6240,wbt,"And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:"
6241,wbt,And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:
6242,wbt,And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.
6243,wbt,"And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begat Enos:"
6244,wbt,"And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:"
6245,wbt,And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years; and he died.
6246,wbt,"And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan."
6247,wbt,"And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:"
6248,wbt,And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years; and he died.
6249,wbt,"And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel:"
6250,wbt,"And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:"
6251,wbt,And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.
6252,wbt,"And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:"
6253,wbt,"And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:"
6254,wbt,And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years; and he died.
6255,wbt,"And Jared lived a hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch:"
6256,wbt,"And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:"
6257,wbt,And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years; and he died.
6258,wbt,"And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:"
6259,wbt,"And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:"
6260,wbt,And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:
6261,wbt,"And Enoch walked with God, and he was not: for God took him."
6262,wbt,"And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech:"
6263,wbt,"And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:"
6264,wbt,And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years; and he died.
6265,wbt,And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years; and begat a son:
6266,wbt,"And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed."
6267,wbt,"And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:"
6268,wbt,And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years; and he died.
6269,wbt,"And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
6270,wbt,"And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them,"
6271,wbt,That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all whom they chose.
6272,wbt,"And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years."
6273,wbt,"There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them: the same became mighty men, who were of old, men of renown."
6274,wbt,"And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."
6275,wbt,"And the LORD repented that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart."
6276,wbt,"And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created, from the face of the earth, both man and beast, and the creeping animal, and the fowls of the air; for I repent that I have made them."
6277,wbt,But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
6278,wbt,"These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man, and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God."
6279,wbt,"And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
6280,wbt,The earth also was corrupt before God; and the earth was filled with violence.
6281,wbt,"And God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt: for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth."
6282,wbt,"And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them: and behold, I will destroy them with the earth."
6283,wbt,"Make thee an ark of gopher-wood: rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch."
6284,wbt,"And this is the fashion in which thou shalt make it: the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits."
6285,wbt,"A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in its side: with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it."
6286,wbt,"And behold, I, even I do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, in which is the breath of life, from under heaven: and every thing that is on the earth shall die."
6287,wbt,"But with thee will I establish my covenant: and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee."
6288,wbt,"And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee: they shall be male and female."
6289,wbt,"Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping animal of the earth after its kind, two of every sort shall come to thee, to keep them alive."
6290,wbt,"And take thou to thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them."
6291,wbt,"Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he."
6292,wbt,"And the LORD said to Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark: for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation."
6293,wbt,"Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female."
6294,wbt,"Of fowls of the air also by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive on the face of all the earth."
6295,wbt,"For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights: and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from the face of the earth."
6296,wbt,And Noah did according to all that the LORD commanded him.
6297,wbt,And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was on the earth.
6298,wbt,"And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood."
6299,wbt,"Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every animal that creepeth upon the earth;"
6300,wbt,"There went in two and two to Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah."
6301,wbt,"And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth."
6302,wbt,"In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened."
6303,wbt,And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
6304,wbt,"In the same day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark."
6305,wbt,"They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort."
6306,wbt,"And they went in to Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, in which is the breath of life."
6307,wbt,"And they that entered, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in."
6308,wbt,"And the flood was forty days upon the earth: and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it was lifted above the earth."
6309,wbt,"And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth: and the ark moved upon the face of the waters."
6310,wbt,And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered.
6311,wbt,Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail: and the mountains were covered.
6312,wbt,"And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:"
6313,wbt,"All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was on the dry land, died."
6314,wbt,"And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping animals, and the fowl of heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth; and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark."
6315,wbt,And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.
6316,wbt,"And God remembered Noah, and every living animal, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters were checked."
6317,wbt,"The fountains also of the deep, and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;"
6318,wbt,And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
6319,wbt,"And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat."
6320,wbt,"And the waters decreased continually, till the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen."
6321,wbt,"And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:"
6322,wbt,"And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, till the waters were dried from off the earth."
6323,wbt,"Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;"
6324,wbt,"But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned to him into the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth. Then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in to him into the ark."
6325,wbt,"And he stayed yet other seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;"
6326,wbt,"And the dove came in to him in the evening, and lo, in her mouth was an olive-leaf plucked off: So Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth."
6327,wbt,"And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; which returned not again to him any more."
6328,wbt,"And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry."
6329,wbt,"And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried."
6330,wbt,"And God spoke to Noah, saying,"
6331,wbt,"Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee."
6332,wbt,"Bring forth with thee every living animal that is with thee, of all flesh, of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth."
6333,wbt,"And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:"
6334,wbt,"Every beast, every creeping animal, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went out of the ark."
6335,wbt,"And Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar."
6336,wbt,"And the LORD smelled a sweet savor; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth: neither will I again smite any more every living animal as I have done."
6337,wbt,"While the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."
6338,wbt,"And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth."
6339,wbt,"And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth on the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered."
6340,wbt,Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things:
6341,wbt,"But flesh with the life of it, which is its blood, shall ye not eat."
6342,wbt,"And surely your blood of your lives will I require: at the hand of every beast will I require it: and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man."
6343,wbt,"Whoever sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man."
6344,wbt,"And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply, bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein."
6345,wbt,"And God spoke to Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,"
6346,wbt,"And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;"
6347,wbt,"And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you, from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth."
6348,wbt,And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
6349,wbt,"And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations."
6350,wbt,"I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth."
6351,wbt,"And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:"
6352,wbt,"And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh."
6353,wbt,"And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth."
6354,wbt,"And God said to Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth."
6355,wbt,"And the sons of Noah that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham was the father of Canaan."
6356,wbt,These three were the sons of Noah: and from them was the whole earth overspread.
6357,wbt,"And Noah began to be a husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:"
6358,wbt,"And he drank the wine, and was drunken, and he was uncovered within his tent."
6359,wbt,"And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without."
6360,wbt,"And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father: and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness."
6361,wbt,"And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done to him."
6362,wbt,"And he said, Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be to his brethren."
6363,wbt,"And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant."
6364,wbt,"God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant."
6365,wbt,And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
6366,wbt,And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.
6367,wbt,"Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah; Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and to them were sons born after the flood."
6368,wbt,"The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras."
6369,wbt,"And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah."
6370,wbt,"And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim."
6371,wbt,"By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations."
6372,wbt,"And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan."
6373,wbt,"And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha; and the sons of Raamah, Sheba, and Dedan."
6374,wbt,And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
6375,wbt,"He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD."
6376,wbt,"And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar."
6377,wbt,"Out of that land went forth Ashur, and built Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,"
6378,wbt,And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.
6379,wbt,"And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim."
6380,wbt,"And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim."
6381,wbt,"And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth,"
6382,wbt,"And the Jebusite, and the Emorite, and the Girgasite,"
6383,wbt,"And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,"
6384,wbt,"And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites dispersed."
6385,wbt,"And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, to Gaza; as thou goest to Sodom and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even to Lashah."
6386,wbt,"These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations."
6387,wbt,"To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born."
6388,wbt,"The children of Shem; Elam, and Ashur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram."
6389,wbt,"And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash."
6390,wbt,And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.
6391,wbt,"And to Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg, for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan."
6392,wbt,"And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,"
6393,wbt,"And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah."
6394,wbt,"And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,"
6395,wbt,"And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan."
6396,wbt,"And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest to Sephar, a mount of the east."
6397,wbt,"These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations."
6398,wbt,"These are the families of the sons of Noah after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood."
6399,wbt,"And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech."
6400,wbt,"And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there."
6401,wbt,"And they said one to another, come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar."
6402,wbt,"And they said, come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top may reach to heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we should be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth."
6403,wbt,"And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men were building."
6404,wbt,"And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do."
6405,wbt,"Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech."
6406,wbt,So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.
6407,wbt,"Therefore is the name of it called Babel, because the LORD there confounded the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth."
6408,wbt,"These are the generations of Shem: Shem was a hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:"
6409,wbt,"And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
6410,wbt,"And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah."
6411,wbt,"And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters."
6412,wbt,"And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:"
6413,wbt,"And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters."
6414,wbt,"And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:"
6415,wbt,"And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters."
6416,wbt,"And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:"
6417,wbt,"And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters."
6418,wbt,"And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug."
6419,wbt,"And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters."
6420,wbt,"And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:"
6421,wbt,"And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
6422,wbt,"And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah."
6423,wbt,"And Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters."
6424,wbt,"And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran."
6425,wbt,"Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran: and Haran begat Lot."
6426,wbt,"And Haran died before his father Terah, in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees."
6427,wbt,"And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah."
6428,wbt,But Sarai was barren; she had no child.
6429,wbt,"And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and dwelt there."
6430,wbt,And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
6431,wbt,"Now the LORD had said to Abram, Depart from thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, to a land that I will show thee:"
6432,wbt,"And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:"
6433,wbt,"And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed."
6434,wbt,"So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken to him, and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed from Haran."
6435,wbt,"And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went to go forth into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came."
6436,wbt,"And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land."
6437,wbt,"And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, To thy seed will I give this land: and there he erected an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him."
6438,wbt,"And he removed from thence to a mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he erected an altar to the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD."
6439,wbt,"And Abram journeyed, going on still towards the south."
6440,wbt,And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to dwell there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
6441,wbt,"And it came to pass, when he had come near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:"
6442,wbt,"Therefore it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive."
6443,wbt,"Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee."
6444,wbt,"And it came to pass, that when Abram had come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair."
6445,wbt,"The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house."
6446,wbt,"And he treated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels."
6447,wbt,"And the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues, because of Sarai, Abram's wife."
6448,wbt,"And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done to me? why didst thou not tell me that she is thy wife?"
6449,wbt,"Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me for a wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way."
6450,wbt,"And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had."
6451,wbt,"And Abram returned from Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south."
6452,wbt,"And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold."
6453,wbt,"And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth-el, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Hai;"
6454,wbt,"To the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD."
6455,wbt,"And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents."
6456,wbt,"And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together."
6457,wbt,And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land.
6458,wbt,"And Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we are brethren."
6459,wbt,"Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou wilt depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left."
6460,wbt,"And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest to Zoar."
6461,wbt,Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
6462,wbt,"Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent towards Sodom."
6463,wbt,"But the men of Sodom were wicked, and sinners before the LORD, exceedingly."
6464,wbt,"And the LORD said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:"
6465,wbt,"For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever."
6466,wbt,"And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered."
6467,wbt,"Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to thee."
6468,wbt,"Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar to the LORD."
6469,wbt,"And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;"
6470,wbt,"That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar."
6471,wbt,"All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea."
6472,wbt,"Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled."
6473,wbt,"And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,"
6474,wbt,"And the Horites in their mount Seir, to El-paran, which is by the wilderness."
6475,wbt,"And they returned, and came to En-mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar."
6476,wbt,"And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;"
6477,wbt,"With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five."
6478,wbt,"And the vale of Siddim was full of slime-pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there: and they that remained fled to the mountain."
6479,wbt,"And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way."
6480,wbt,"And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed."
6481,wbt,"And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram."
6482,wbt,"And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them to Dan."
6483,wbt,"And he divided himself against them, he and his servants by night, and smote them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus."
6484,wbt,"And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people."
6485,wbt,"And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale."
6486,wbt,"And Melchisedek, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God."
6487,wbt,"And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:"
6488,wbt,"And blessed be the most high God, who hath delivered thy enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all."
6489,wbt,"And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself."
6490,wbt,"And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted my hand to the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,"
6491,wbt,"That I will not take from a thread even to a shoe-latchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:"
6492,wbt,"Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion."
6493,wbt,"After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward."
6494,wbt,"And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?"
6495,wbt,"And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and lo, one born in my house is my heir."
6496,wbt,"And behold, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, This shall not be thy heir; but he that shall come forth out of thy own bowels shall be thy heir."
6497,wbt,"And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now towards heaven, and tell the stars, if thou art able to number them: and he said to him, So shall thy seed be."
6498,wbt,And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
6499,wbt,"And he said to him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it."
6500,wbt,"And he said, Lord GOD, by what shall I know that I shall inherit it?"
6501,wbt,"And he said to him, Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon."
6502,wbt,"And he took to him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds he did not divide."
6503,wbt,"And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away."
6504,wbt,"And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him."
6505,wbt,"And he said to Abram, Know certainly that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;"
6506,wbt,"And also that nation which they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance."
6507,wbt,And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
6508,wbt,But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
6509,wbt,"And it came to pass, that when the sun had gone down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces."
6510,wbt,"In that same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:"
6511,wbt,"The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,"
6512,wbt,"And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,"
6513,wbt,"And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."
6514,wbt,"Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no children: and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar."
6515,wbt,"And Sarai said to Abram, Behold, now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee go in to my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai."
6516,wbt,"And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife."
6517,wbt,"And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes."
6518,wbt,"And Sarai said to Abram, my wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee."
6519,wbt,"But Abram said to Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face."
6520,wbt,"And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur."
6521,wbt,"And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai."
6522,wbt,"And the angel of the LORD said to her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands."
6523,wbt,"And the angel of the LORD said to her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude."
6524,wbt,"And the angel of the LORD said to her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction."
6525,wbt,"And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren."
6526,wbt,"And she called the name of the LORD that spoke to her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?"
6527,wbt,"Wherefore the well was called Beer-la-hai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered."
6528,wbt,"And Hagar bore Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bore, Ishmael."
6529,wbt,"And Abram was eighty six years old, when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram."
6530,wbt,"And when Abram was ninety and nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said to him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect."
6531,wbt,"And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly."
6532,wbt,"And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,"
6533,wbt,"As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations."
6534,wbt,"Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee."
6535,wbt,"And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of thee; and kings shall proceed from thee."
6536,wbt,"And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in their generations, for an everlasting covenant; to be a God to thee and to thy seed after thee."
6537,wbt,"And I will give to thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land in which thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God."
6538,wbt,"And God said to Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee, in their generations."
6539,wbt,"This is my covenant, which ye shall keep between me and you, and thy seed after thee; Every male-child among you shall be circumcised."
6540,wbt,And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.
6541,wbt,"And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male-child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, who is not of thy seed."
6542,wbt,"He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant."
6543,wbt,"And the uncircumcised male-child, whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant."
6544,wbt,"And God said to Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be."
6545,wbt,"And I will bless her, and give thee a son also by her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall proceed from her."
6546,wbt,"Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born to him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear?"
6547,wbt,"And Abraham said to God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!"
6548,wbt,"And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him."
6549,wbt,"And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation."
6550,wbt,"But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to thee at this set time in the next year."
6551,wbt,"And he ceased talking with him, and God went up from Abraham."
6552,wbt,"And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin, in the same day, as God had said to him."
6553,wbt,"And Abraham was ninety and nine years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin."
6554,wbt,"And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin."
6555,wbt,"In the same day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son."
6556,wbt,"And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him."
6557,wbt,And the LORD appeared to him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
6558,wbt,"And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,"
6559,wbt,"And said, My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:"
6560,wbt,"Let a little water, I pray you, be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:"
6561,wbt,"And I will bring a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that you shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said."
6562,wbt,"And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth."
6563,wbt,"And Abraham ran to the herd, and brought a calf tender and good, and gave it to a young man; and he hasted to dress it."
6564,wbt,"And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they ate."
6565,wbt,"And they said to him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent."
6566,wbt,"And he said, I will certainly return to thee according to the time of life; and lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him."
6567,wbt,Now Abraham and Sarah were old and far advanced in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
6568,wbt,"Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am become old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?"
6569,wbt,"And the LORD said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I certainly bear a child, who am old?"
6570,wbt,"Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return to thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son."
6571,wbt,"Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh."
6572,wbt,"And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way."
6573,wbt,"And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;"
6574,wbt,"Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?"
6575,wbt,"For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they will keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him."
6576,wbt,"And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;"
6577,wbt,"I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come to me; and if not, I will know."
6578,wbt,"And the men turned their faces from thence, and went towards Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD."
6579,wbt,"And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?"
6580,wbt,Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are in it?
6581,wbt,"That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"
6582,wbt,"And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes."
6583,wbt,"And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I, who am dust and ashes, have taken upon me to speak to the Lord."
6584,wbt,"Peradventure there will lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it."
6585,wbt,"And he spoke to him yet again, and said, Peradventure there will be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake."
6586,wbt,"And he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there will thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there."
6587,wbt,"And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak to the Lord: Peradventure there will be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake."
6588,wbt,"And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten will be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake."
6589,wbt,"And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned to his place."
6590,wbt,"And there came two angels to Sodom at evening; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom; and Lot seeing them, rose to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face towards the ground;"
6591,wbt,"And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night."
6592,wbt,"And he urged them greatly; and they turned in to him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate."
6593,wbt,"But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:"
6594,wbt,"And they called to Lot, and said to him, Where are the men who came in to thee this night? bring them out to us, that we may know them."
6595,wbt,"And Lot went out at the door to them, and shut the door after him,"
6596,wbt,"And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly."
6597,wbt,"Behold now, I have two daughters who have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out to you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only to these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof."
6598,wbt,"And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one man came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: Now will we deal worse with thee than with them. And they pressed hard upon the man, Lot, and came near to break the door."
6599,wbt,"But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut the door."
6600,wbt,"And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door."
6601,wbt,"And the men said to Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:"
6602,wbt,"For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them has become great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it."
6603,wbt,"And Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said, Arise, depart from this place; for the LORD will destroy this city: but he seemed to his sons-in-law as one that mocked."
6604,wbt,"And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters who are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city."
6605,wbt,"And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters: the LORD being merciful to him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city."
6606,wbt,"And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life: look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain: escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed."
6607,wbt,"And Lot said to them, Oh, not so, my Lord!"
6608,wbt,"Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shown to me in saving my life: and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil should take me, and I die:"
6609,wbt,"Behold now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a small one: Oh, let me escape thither! (Is it not a small one?) and my soul shall live."
6610,wbt,"And he said to him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for which thou hast spoken."
6611,wbt,"Haste thee, escape thither: for I cannot do any thing till thou hast come thither: therefore the name of the city was called Zoar."
6612,wbt,The sun had risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
6613,wbt,Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
6614,wbt,"And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground."
6615,wbt,"But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt."
6616,wbt,"And Abraham rose early in the morning, to the place were he stood before the LORD:"
6617,wbt,"And he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah, and towards all the land of the plain, and beheld, and lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace."
6618,wbt,"And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt."
6619,wbt,"And Lot went up from Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he, and his two daughters."
6620,wbt,"And the first-born said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man on the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth:"
6621,wbt,"Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father."
6622,wbt,"And they made their father drink wine that night: and the first-born went in and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
6623,wbt,"And it came to pass on the morrow that the first born said to the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father; let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father."
6624,wbt,"And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
6625,wbt,Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
6626,wbt,"And the first-born bore a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites to this day."
6627,wbt,"And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon to this day."
6628,wbt,"And Abraham journeyed from thence towards the south country, and dwelt between Kadash and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar."
6629,wbt,"And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, she is my sister: And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah."
6630,wbt,"But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, on account of the woman whom thou hast taken: for she is a man's wife."
6631,wbt,"But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou also slay a righteous nation?"
6632,wbt,"Said he not to me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart, and innocence of my hands have I done this."
6633,wbt,"And God said to him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore I suffered thee not to touch her."
6634,wbt,"Now therefore restore to the man his wife, for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou shalt not restore her, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are thine."
6635,wbt,"Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were greatly afraid."
6636,wbt,"Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, What has thou done to us? and in what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds to me that ought not to be done."
6637,wbt,"And Abimelech said to Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?"
6638,wbt,"And Abraham said, Because I thought, surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake."
6639,wbt,"And yet indeed she is my sister: she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife."
6640,wbt,"And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show to me; At every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother."
6641,wbt,"And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and men-servants, and women-servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored to him Sarah his wife."
6642,wbt,"And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee."
6643,wbt,"And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, to all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved."
6644,wbt,"So Abraham prayed to God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants, and they bore children."
6645,wbt,"For the LORD had made barren all the females of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife."
6646,wbt,"And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had spoken."
6647,wbt,"For Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him."
6648,wbt,"And Abraham called the name of his son that was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac."
6649,wbt,"And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, being eight days old, as God had commanded him."
6650,wbt,"And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born to him."
6651,wbt,"And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me."
6652,wbt,"And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah shall nurse children? for I have borne him a son in his old age."
6653,wbt,"And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the day that Isaac was weaned."
6654,wbt,"And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had borne to Abraham, mocking."
6655,wbt,"Wherefore, she said to Abraham, Cast out this bond-woman, and her son: for the son of this bond-woman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac."
6656,wbt,"And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight, because of his son."
6657,wbt,"And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight, because of the lad, and because of thy bond-woman; in all that Sarah hath said to thee, hearken to her voice: for in Isaac shall thy seed be called."
6658,wbt,"And also of the son of the bond-woman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed."
6659,wbt,"And Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar (putting it on her shoulder) and the child, and sent her away; and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba."
6660,wbt,"And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs."
6661,wbt,"And she went, and sat her down over against him, a good way off, as it were a bow-shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and raised her voice, and wept."
6662,wbt,"And God heard the voice of the lad: and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is."
6663,wbt,"Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand: for I will make him a great nation."
6664,wbt,"And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water: and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink."
6665,wbt,"And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer."
6666,wbt,And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took for him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
6667,wbt,"And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:"
6668,wbt,"Now therefore swear to me here by God, that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land in which thou hast sojourned."
6669,wbt,"And Abraham said, I will swear."
6670,wbt,"And Abraham reproved Abimelech, because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away."
6671,wbt,"And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet have I heard of it, but to-day."
6672,wbt,"And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech: and both of them made a covenant."
6673,wbt,And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves.
6674,wbt,"And Abimelech said to Abraham, What mean these seven ewe-lambs, which thou hast set by themselves?"
6675,wbt,"And he said, For these seven ewe-lambs shalt thou take from my hand, that they may be a witness to me, that I have digged this well."
6676,wbt,Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba: because there they swore both of them.
6677,wbt,"Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: Then Abimelech arose, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines."
6678,wbt,"And Abraham planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God."
6679,wbt,And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.
6680,wbt,"And it came to pass after these things, that God tempted Abraham, and said to him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am."
6681,wbt,"And he said, Take now thy son, thy only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will name to thee."
6682,wbt,"And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and cleft the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose and went to the place which God had named to him."
6683,wbt,"Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off."
6684,wbt,"And Abraham said to his young men, Abide you here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and return to you."
6685,wbt,"And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife: and they went both of them together."
6686,wbt,"And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?"
6687,wbt,"And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt-offering: so they went both of them together."
6688,wbt,"And they came to the place which God had named to him; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order; and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood."
6689,wbt,"And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son."
6690,wbt,"And the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here am I."
6691,wbt,"And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing to him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld from me thy son, thy only son."
6692,wbt,"And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son."
6693,wbt,"And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it will be seen."
6694,wbt,"And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven the second time,"
6695,wbt,"And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thy only son:"
6696,wbt,"That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is on the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;"
6697,wbt,And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed: because thou hast obeyed my voice.
6698,wbt,"So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba."
6699,wbt,"And it came to pass after these things, that it was told to Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also borne children to thy brother Nahor;"
6700,wbt,"Huz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,"
6701,wbt,"And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
6702,wbt,And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah bore to Nahor Abraham's brother.
6703,wbt,"And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bore also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah."
6704,wbt,And Sarah was a hundred and twenty-seven years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.
6705,wbt,"And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her."
6706,wbt,"And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,"
6707,wbt,"I am a stranger and a sojourner with you; give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
6708,wbt,"And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,"
6709,wbt,"Hear us, my lord; thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchers bury thy dead: none of us will withhold from thee his sepulcher, but that thou mayest bury thy dead."
6710,wbt,"And Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land, to the children of Heth."
6711,wbt,"And he communed with them, saying, If it is your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,"
6712,wbt,"That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me, for a possession of a burying-place among you."
6713,wbt,"And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, of all that entered the gates of his city, saying,"
6714,wbt,"Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I to thee, and the cave that is in it, I give it to thee; in the presence of the sons of my people I give it to thee: bury thy dead."
6715,wbt,And Abraham bowed himself before the people of the land.
6716,wbt,"And he spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field: take it of me, and I will bury my dead there."
6717,wbt,"And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,"
6718,wbt,"My lord, hearken to me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead."
6719,wbt,"And Abraham hearkened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant."
6720,wbt,"And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field and the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure"
6721,wbt,"To Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that entered the gate of his city."
6722,wbt,"And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan."
6723,wbt,"And the field, and the cave that is in it were made sure to Abraham for a possession of a burying-place, by the sons of Heth."
6724,wbt,And Abraham was old and far advanced in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.
6725,wbt,"And Abraham said to his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:"
6726,wbt,"And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that thou wilt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell:"
6727,wbt,"But thou shalt go to my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac."
6728,wbt,"And the servant said to him, It may be the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land: must I needs bring thy son again to the land from whence thou camest?"
6729,wbt,"And Abraham said to him, Beware that thou bring not my son thither again."
6730,wbt,"The LORD God of heaven, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, To thy seed I will give this land: he will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence."
6731,wbt,"And if the woman shall not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath; only bring not my son thither again."
6732,wbt,"And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning that matter."
6733,wbt,"And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed; (for all the goods of his master were in his hands:) and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor."
6734,wbt,"And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water, at the time of the evening, the time when women go out to draw water:"
6735,wbt,"And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, prosper me this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham."
6736,wbt,"Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:"
6737,wbt,"And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and by that shall I know that thou hast shown kindness to my master."
6738,wbt,"And it came to pass before he had done speaking, that behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder."
6739,wbt,"And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up."
6740,wbt,"And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water from thy pitcher."
6741,wbt,"And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink."
6742,wbt,"And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, till they have done drinking."
6743,wbt,"And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels."
6744,wbt,"And the man, wondering at her, held his peace, to know whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous, or not."
6745,wbt,"And it came to pass as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ear-ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;"
6746,wbt,"And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?"
6747,wbt,"And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor."
6748,wbt,"She said moreover to him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in."
6749,wbt,"And the man bowed his head, and worshipped the LORD."
6750,wbt,"And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left my master destitute of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren."
6751,wbt,"And the damsel ran, and told these things to her mother's house."
6752,wbt,"And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out to the man, to the well."
6753,wbt,"And it came to pass when he saw the ear-ring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man to me; that he came to the man; and behold, he stood by the camels at the well."
6754,wbt,"And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; why standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels."
6755,wbt,"And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him."
6756,wbt,"And there was set food before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told my errand. And he said, Speak on."
6757,wbt,"And he said, I am Abraham's servant."
6758,wbt,"And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly, and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and camels, and asses."
6759,wbt,"And Sarah, my master's wife, bore a son to my master when she was old: and to him hath he given all that he hath."
6760,wbt,"And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:"
6761,wbt,"But thou shalt go to my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son."
6762,wbt,"And I said to my master, It may be the woman will not follow me."
6763,wbt,"And he said to me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house."
6764,wbt,"Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath."
6765,wbt,"And I came this day to the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou dost prosper my way which I go:"
6766,wbt,"Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;"
6767,wbt,"And she saith to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath pointed out for my master's son."
6768,wbt,"And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down to the well, and drew water: and I said to her, Let me drink, I pray thee."
6769,wbt,"And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also."
6770,wbt,"And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him: and I put the ear-ring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands."
6771,wbt,"And I bowed my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son."
6772,wbt,"And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left."
6773,wbt,"Then Laban and Bethuel answered, and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak to thee bad or good."
6774,wbt,"Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken."
6775,wbt,"And it came to pass, that when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth."
6776,wbt,"And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: He gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things."
6777,wbt,"And they ate and drank, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master."
6778,wbt,"And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go."
6779,wbt,"And he said to them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way: send me away, that I may go to my master."
6780,wbt,"And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth."
6781,wbt,"And they called Rebekah, and said to her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go."
6782,wbt,"And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men."
6783,wbt,"And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those who hate them."
6784,wbt,"And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way."
6785,wbt,And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country.
6786,wbt,"And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at evening: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and behold, the camels were coming."
6787,wbt,"And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel."
6788,wbt,"For she had said to the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail and covered herself."
6789,wbt,And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
6790,wbt,"And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death."
6791,wbt,"Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah."
6792,wbt,"And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah."
6793,wbt,"And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim and Leummim."
6794,wbt,"And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah."
6795,wbt,And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.
6796,wbt,"But to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son (while he yet lived) eastward, to the east country."
6797,wbt,"And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred and seventy five years."
6798,wbt,"Then Abraham expired, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people."
6799,wbt,"And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;"
6800,wbt,"The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife."
6801,wbt,"And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac: and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi."
6802,wbt,"Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore to Abraham."
6803,wbt,"And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: The first-born of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,"
6804,wbt,"And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,"
6805,wbt,"Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:"
6806,wbt,"These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations."
6807,wbt,"And these are the years of the life of Ishmael; a hundred and thirty and seven years: and he expired and died, and was gathered to his people."
6808,wbt,"And they dwelt from Havilah to Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest towards Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren."
6809,wbt,"And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:"
6810,wbt,"And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian."
6811,wbt,"And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived."
6812,wbt,"And the children struggled together within her: and she said, If it is so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of the LORD."
6813,wbt,"And the LORD said to her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels: and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger."
6814,wbt,"And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb."
6815,wbt,"And the first was born red, all over like a hairy garment: and they called his name Esau."
6816,wbt,"And after that his brother was born, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them."
6817,wbt,"And the boys grew: and Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents."
6818,wbt,"And Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob."
6819,wbt,"And Jacob boiled pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint."
6820,wbt,"And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom."
6821,wbt,"And Jacob said, Sell to me this day thy birth-right."
6822,wbt,"And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birth-right bring to me?"
6823,wbt,"And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he swore to him: and he sold his birth-right to Jacob."
6824,wbt,"Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he ate and drank, and rose and went his way: thus Esau despised his birth-right."
6825,wbt,"And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar."
6826,wbt,"And the LORD appeared to him, and said, Go not down into Egypt: dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of."
6827,wbt,"Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee: for to thee, and to thy seed I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I swore to Abraham thy father;"
6828,wbt,"And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give to thy seed all these countries: and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed:"
6829,wbt,"Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
6830,wbt,And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:
6831,wbt,"And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon."
6832,wbt,"And it came to pass when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife."
6833,wbt,"And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, surely she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? and Isaac said to him, Because I said, Lest I should die on her account."
6834,wbt,"And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done to us? one of the people might lightly have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldst have brought guiltiness upon us."
6835,wbt,"And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death."
6836,wbt,"Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundred-fold: and the LORD blessed him:"
6837,wbt,"And the man became great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:"
6838,wbt,"For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and very many servants: And the Philistines envied him."
6839,wbt,"For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth."
6840,wbt,"And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go from us: for thou art much mightier than we."
6841,wbt,"And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there."
6842,wbt,And Isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
6843,wbt,"And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water."
6844,wbt,"And the herdmen of Gerar contended with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him."
6845,wbt,"And they digged another well, and contended for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah."
6846,wbt,"And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they did not contend: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land."
6847,wbt,And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.
6848,wbt,"And the LORD appeared to him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake."
6849,wbt,"And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well."
6850,wbt,"Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army."
6851,wbt,"And Isaac said to them, Why come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?"
6852,wbt,"And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;"
6853,wbt,"That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done to thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD."
6854,wbt,"And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank."
6855,wbt,"And they rose betimes in the morning, and swore one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace."
6856,wbt,"And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said to him, We have found water."
6857,wbt,And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.
6858,wbt,"And Esau was forty years old when he took for a wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:"
6859,wbt,Who were a grief of mind to Isaac and Rebekah.
6860,wbt,"And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said to him, My son: and he said to him, Behold, here am I."
6861,wbt,"And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:"
6862,wbt,"Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;"
6863,wbt,"And make me savory meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die."
6864,wbt,"And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son; and Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it."
6865,wbt,"And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak to Esau thy brother, saying,"
6866,wbt,"Bring me venison, and make me savory meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD, before my death."
6867,wbt,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice, according to that which I command thee."
6868,wbt,"Go now to the flock, and bring me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savory meat for thy father, such as he loveth:"
6869,wbt,"And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death."
6870,wbt,"And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:"
6871,wbt,"My father perhaps will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing."
6872,wbt,"And his mother said to him, upon me be thy curse, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me."
6873,wbt,"And he went, and took, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savory meat, such as his father loved."
6874,wbt,"And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which was with her in the house, and put it upon Jacob her younger son:"
6875,wbt,"And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands, and on the smooth part of his neck:"
6876,wbt,"And she gave the savory meat, and the bread which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob."
6877,wbt,"And he came to his father, and said, My father: And he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?"
6878,wbt,"And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau thy first-born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me."
6879,wbt,"And Isaac said to his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me."
6880,wbt,"And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou art my very son Esau, or not."
6881,wbt,"And Jacob went near to Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
6882,wbt,"And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: So he blessed him."
6883,wbt,"And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am."
6884,wbt,"And he said, bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he ate: and he brought him wine, and he drank."
6885,wbt,"And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son."
6886,wbt,"And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:"
6887,wbt,"Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:"
6888,wbt,"Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee; be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee."
6889,wbt,"And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had yet scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting."
6890,wbt,"And he also had made savory meat, and brought it to his father; and said to his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me."
6891,wbt,"And Isaac his father said to him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy first-born Esau."
6892,wbt,"And Isaac trembled exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed."
6893,wbt,"And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceedingly bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father."
6894,wbt,"And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing."
6895,wbt,"And he said, Is he not rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me twice: he took away my birth-right; and behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?"
6896,wbt,"And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now to thee, my son?"
6897,wbt,"And Esau said to his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept."
6898,wbt,"And Isaac his father answered, and said to him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;"
6899,wbt,"And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother: and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck."
6900,wbt,"And Esau hated Jacob, because of the blessing with which his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob."
6901,wbt,"And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as concerning thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee."
6902,wbt,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice: and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;"
6903,wbt,"And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury shall turn away;"
6904,wbt,"Till thy brother's anger shall turn away from thee, and he shall forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and bring thee from thence. Why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?"
6905,wbt,"And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life, because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob shall take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these who are of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?"
6906,wbt,"And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said to him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan."
6907,wbt,"Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother."
6908,wbt,"And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;"
6909,wbt,"And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land in which thou art a stranger, which God gave to Abraham."
6910,wbt,"And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan-aram, to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother."
6911,wbt,"When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him, he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;"
6912,wbt,"And that Jacob obeyed his father, and his mother, and was gone to Padan-aram;"
6913,wbt,And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;
6914,wbt,"Then went Esau to Ishmael, and took to the wives which he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife."
6915,wbt,"And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went towards Haran."
6916,wbt,"And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set: and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep."
6917,wbt,"And he dreamed, and behold, a ladder set upon the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it."
6918,wbt,"And behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land on which thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed."
6919,wbt,"And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth; and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
6920,wbt,"And behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land: for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have declared to thee."
6921,wbt,"And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not."
6922,wbt,"And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is no other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."
6923,wbt,"And Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it."
6924,wbt,And he called the name of that place Beth-el: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.
6925,wbt,"And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,"
6926,wbt,So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:
6927,wbt,"And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me, I will surely give the tenth to thee."
6928,wbt,"Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east."
6929,wbt,"And he looked, and behold, a well in the field, and lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth."
6930,wbt,"And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in its place."
6931,wbt,"And Jacob said to them, My brethren, whence are ye? And they said, We are from Haran."
6932,wbt,"And he said to them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? and they said, We know him."
6933,wbt,"And he said to them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep."
6934,wbt,"And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be collected: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them."
6935,wbt,"And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks are collected, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep."
6936,wbt,"And while he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she kept them."
6937,wbt,"And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother; that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother."
6938,wbt,"And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept."
6939,wbt,"And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son; and she ran and told her father."
6940,wbt,"And it came to pass when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things."
6941,wbt,"And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh: and he abode with him the space of a month."
6942,wbt,"And Laban said to Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for naught? tell me, what shall thy wages be?"
6943,wbt,"And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel."
6944,wbt,"Leah was tender-eyed, but Rachel was beautiful and well-favored."
6945,wbt,"And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter."
6946,wbt,"And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me."
6947,wbt,"And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had to her."
6948,wbt,"And Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife (for my days are fulfilled) that I may go in to her."
6949,wbt,"And Laban assembled all the men of the place, and made a feast."
6950,wbt,"And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in to her."
6951,wbt,"And Laban gave to his daughter Leah, Zilpah his maid for a handmaid."
6952,wbt,"And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done to me? did I not serve with thee for Rachel? why then hast thou deceived me?"
6953,wbt,"And Laban said, it must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the first-born."
6954,wbt,"Fulfill her week, and we will give thee this also, for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years."
6955,wbt,"And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel, his daughter, for a wife also."
6956,wbt,"And Laban gave to Rachel, his daughter, Bilhah, his handmaid, to be her maid."
6957,wbt,"And he went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years."
6958,wbt,"And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he made her fruitful: but Rachel was barren."
6959,wbt,"And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me."
6960,wbt,"And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon."
6961,wbt,"And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Now this time will my husband adhere to me, because I have borne him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi."
6962,wbt,"And she conceived again, and bore a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah, and left bearing."
6963,wbt,"And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said to Jacob, Give me children, or else I die."
6964,wbt,"And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel; and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?"
6965,wbt,"And she said, Behold, my maid Bilhah, go in to her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her."
6966,wbt,"And she gave him Bilhah, her handmaid, for a wife: and Jacob went in to her."
6967,wbt,"And Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son."
6968,wbt,"And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore she called his name Dan."
6969,wbt,"And Bilhah, Rachel's maid, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son."
6970,wbt,"And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali."
6971,wbt,"When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah, her maid, and gave her Jacob for a wife."
6972,wbt,"And Zilpah, Leah's maid, bore Jacob a son."
6973,wbt,"And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad."
6974,wbt,"And Zilpah, Leah's maid, bore Jacob a second son."
6975,wbt,"And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher."
6976,wbt,"And Reuben went, in the days of wheat-harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes."
6977,wbt,"And she said to her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son's mandrakes."
6978,wbt,"And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in to me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night."
6979,wbt,"And God hearkened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob the fifth son."
6980,wbt,"And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar."
6981,wbt,"And Leah conceived again, and bore Jacob the sixth son."
6982,wbt,"And Leah said, God hath endowed me with a good dower; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun."
6983,wbt,"And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah."
6984,wbt,"And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and rendered her fruitful."
6985,wbt,"And she conceived, and bore a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:"
6986,wbt,"And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD will add to me another son."
6987,wbt,"And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country."
6988,wbt,"Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee."
6989,wbt,"And Laban said to him, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience, that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake."
6990,wbt,"And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it."
6991,wbt,"And he said to him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle were with me."
6992,wbt,"For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased to a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for my own house also?"
6993,wbt,"And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing; if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock:"
6994,wbt,"I will pass through all thy flock to-day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire."
6995,wbt,"So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be accounted stolen with me."
6996,wbt,"And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word."
6997,wbt,"And he removed that day the he-goats that were ring-streaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted; every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hands of his sons."
6998,wbt,And he set three days' journey between himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
6999,wbt,"And Jacob took to him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut-tree; and peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods."
7000,wbt,"And he set the rods, which he had peeled, before the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs, when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink."
7001,wbt,"And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ring-streaked, speckled, and spotted."
7002,wbt,"And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks towards the ring-streaked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban: and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not with Laban's cattle."
7003,wbt,"And it came to pass, whenever the stronger cattle conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods."
7004,wbt,"But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's."
7005,wbt,"And the man increased exceedingly, and had many cattle, and maid-servants, and men-servants, and camels, and asses."
7006,wbt,"And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he obtained all this glory."
7007,wbt,"And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and behold, it was not towards him as before."
7008,wbt,"And the LORD said to Jacob, Return to the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee."
7009,wbt,"And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field to his flock,"
7010,wbt,"And said to them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not towards me as before: but the God of my father hath been with me."
7011,wbt,And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
7012,wbt,"And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times: but God suffered him not to hurt me."
7013,wbt,"If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bore speckled: and if he said thus, The ring-streaked shall be thy hire; then all the cattle bore ring-streaked."
7014,wbt,"Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me."
7015,wbt,"And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled."
7016,wbt,"And the angel of God spoke to me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I."
7017,wbt,"And he said, Lift up now thy eyes and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth to thee."
7018,wbt,"I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst to me a vow: now arise, depart from this land, and return to the land of thy kindred."
7019,wbt,"And Rachel and Leah answered, and said to him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?"
7020,wbt,"Are we not counted by him strangers; for he hath sold us, and hath quite consumed also our money."
7021,wbt,"For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then whatever God hath said to thee, do."
7022,wbt,"Then Jacob arose, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;"
7023,wbt,"And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gained, the cattle of his getting, which he had gained in Padan-aram; to go to Isaac, his father, in the land of Canaan."
7024,wbt,And Laban went to shear his sheep; and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.
7025,wbt,"And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he was about to depart."
7026,wbt,"So he fled with all that he had; and he arose, and passed over the river, and set his face towards the mount Gilead."
7027,wbt,And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled.
7028,wbt,"And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey: and they overtook him in the mount Gilead."
7029,wbt,"And God came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream by night, and said to him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
7030,wbt,"Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban, with his brethren, pitched in the mount of Gilead."
7031,wbt,"And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?"
7032,wbt,"Why didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?"
7033,wbt,"And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons, and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing."
7034,wbt,"It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spoke to me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
7035,wbt,"And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou didst earnestly long after thy father's house; yet why hast thou stolen my gods?"
7036,wbt,"And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, It may be thou wouldest take thy daughters from me by force."
7037,wbt,"With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee: for Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them."
7038,wbt,"And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maid-servants' tents; but he found them not. Then he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent."
7039,wbt,"Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not."
7040,wbt,"And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images."
7041,wbt,"And Jacob was wroth, and chid with Laban: and Jacob answered, and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so eagerly pursued after me?"
7042,wbt,"Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household-stuff? set it here before my brethren, and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both."
7043,wbt,"These twenty years have I been with thee: thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten."
7044,wbt,"That which was torn by beasts, I brought not to thee; I bore the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night."
7045,wbt,"Thus I was; in the day the drouth consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from my eyes."
7046,wbt,"Thus have I been twenty years in thy house: I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times."
7047,wbt,"Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac had been with me, surely thou hadst now sent me away empty. God hath seen my affliction, and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight."
7048,wbt,"And Laban answered, and said to Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine; and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children which they have borne?"
7049,wbt,"Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee."
7050,wbt,"And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar."
7051,wbt,"And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they ate there upon the heap."
7052,wbt,And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed:
7053,wbt,"And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed:"
7054,wbt,"And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another."
7055,wbt,"If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives besides my daughters; no man is with us; See, God is witness betwixt me and thee."
7056,wbt,"And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;"
7057,wbt,"This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm."
7058,wbt,"The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac."
7059,wbt,"Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they ate bread, and tarried all night in the mount."
7060,wbt,"And early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned to his place."
7061,wbt,"And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him."
7062,wbt,"And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim."
7063,wbt,"And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, to the land of Seir, the country of Edom."
7064,wbt,"And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak to my lord Esau: Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there till now:"
7065,wbt,"And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and men-servants, and women-servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight."
7066,wbt,"And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he is coming to meet thee, and four hundred men with him."
7067,wbt,"Then Jacob was greatly afraid, and distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and herds, and camels, into two bands;"
7068,wbt,"And said, If Esau shall come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left, will escape."
7069,wbt,"And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD who saidst to me, Return to thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee;"
7070,wbt,"I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shown to thy servant: for with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands."
7071,wbt,"Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he shall come and smite me, and the mother with the children."
7072,wbt,"And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude."
7073,wbt,"And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau, his brother;"
7074,wbt,"Two hundred she-goats, and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,"
7075,wbt,"Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals."
7076,wbt,"And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said to his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove."
7077,wbt,"And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau, my brother, meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?"
7078,wbt,"Then thou shalt say, They are thy servant Jacob's: it is a present sent to my lord Esau: and behold also he is behind us."
7079,wbt,"And so he commanded the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, In this manner shall ye speak to Esau, when ye find him."
7080,wbt,"And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me."
7081,wbt,So the present went over before him; and he himself lodged that night in the company.
7082,wbt,"And he arose that night, and took his two wives, and his two women-servants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok."
7083,wbt,"And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that which he had."
7084,wbt,"And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him, until the breaking of the day."
7085,wbt,"And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh: and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him."
7086,wbt,"And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh; And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me."
7087,wbt,"And he said to him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob."
7088,wbt,"And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God, and with men, and hast prevailed."
7089,wbt,"And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name: And he said, why is it that thou dost ask after my name? and he blessed him there."
7090,wbt,"And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved."
7091,wbt,"And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh."
7092,wbt,"Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrunk, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, to this day; because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrunk."
7093,wbt,"And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children to Leah, and to Rachel, and to the two handmaids."
7094,wbt,"And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost."
7095,wbt,"And he passed on before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, till he came near to his brother."
7096,wbt,"And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept."
7097,wbt,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children, and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given to thy servant."
7098,wbt,"Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves."
7099,wbt,"And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves; and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves."
7100,wbt,"And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, these are to find grace in the sight of my lord."
7101,wbt,"And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep what thou hast to thyself."
7102,wbt,"And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou hast been pleased with me."
7103,wbt,"Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough: and he urged him, and he took it."
7104,wbt,"And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee."
7105,wbt,"And he said to him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me, and if men should over-drive them one day, all the flock will die."
7106,wbt,"Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on slowly, according as the cattle that go before me, and the children are able to endure; until I come to my lord to Seir."
7107,wbt,"And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the people that are with me: And he said, What needeth it? Let me find grace in the sight of my lord."
7108,wbt,So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
7109,wbt,"And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth."
7110,wbt,"And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and pitched his tent before the city."
7111,wbt,"And he bought a part of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of money."
7112,wbt,"And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel."
7113,wbt,"And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land."
7114,wbt,"And when Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her."
7115,wbt,"And his soul cleaved to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spoke kindly to the damsel."
7116,wbt,"And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel for a wife."
7117,wbt,And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter (now his sons were with his cattle in the field:) and Jacob held his peace till they had come.
7118,wbt,And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to commune with him.
7119,wbt,"And the sons of Jacob came from the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel, in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done."
7120,wbt,"And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her to him for a wife."
7121,wbt,"And make ye marriages with us: give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to you."
7122,wbt,"And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein."
7123,wbt,"And Shechem said to her father, and to her brethren, Let me find favor in your eyes, and what ye shall say to me, I will give."
7124,wbt,"Ask me never so much dower and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say to me: but give me the damsel for a wife."
7125,wbt,"And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, (because he had defiled Dinah their sister,)"
7126,wbt,"And they said to them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised: for that would be a reproach to us:"
7127,wbt,"But in this will we consent to you: If ye will be as we are, that every male of you shall be circumcised;"
7128,wbt,"Then will we give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people."
7129,wbt,"But if ye will not hearken to us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone."
7130,wbt,"And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son."
7131,wbt,"And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honorable than all the house of his father."
7132,wbt,"And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,"
7133,wbt,"These men are peaceable with us, therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein: for the land, behold, it is large enough for them: let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters."
7134,wbt,"Only herein, will the men consent to us to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us shall be circumcised, as they are circumcised."
7135,wbt,"Will not their cattle, and their substance, and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us."
7136,wbt,"And to Hamor and to Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city: and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city."
7137,wbt,"And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males."
7138,wbt,"And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out."
7139,wbt,"The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city; because they had defiled their sister."
7140,wbt,"They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field."
7141,wbt,"And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives they took captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house."
7142,wbt,"And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me odious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites, and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they will assemble themselves against me, and slay me, and I shall be destroyed, I and my house."
7143,wbt,"And they said, Should he deal with our sister, as with a harlot?"
7144,wbt,"And God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar to God, who appeared to thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother."
7145,wbt,"Then Jacob said to his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:"
7146,wbt,"And let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went."
7147,wbt,"And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and the ear-rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem."
7148,wbt,"And they journeyed: and the terror of God was on the cities that were round them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob."
7149,wbt,"So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (that is Beth-el) he and all the people that were with him."
7150,wbt,"And he erected there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el; because there God appeared to him, when he fled from the face of his brother."
7151,wbt,"But Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried beneath Beth-el, under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth."
7152,wbt,And God appeared to Jacob again when he came out of Padan-aram; and blessed him.
7153,wbt,"And God said to him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; and he called his name Israel."
7154,wbt,"And God said to him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a multitude of nations shall spring from thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins."
7155,wbt,"And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land."
7156,wbt,"And God went up from him, in the place where he talked with him."
7157,wbt,"And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink-offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon."
7158,wbt,"And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Beth-el."
7159,wbt,"And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor."
7160,wbt,"And it came to pass when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also."
7161,wbt,And it came to pass as her soul was in departing (for she died) that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.
7162,wbt,"And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Beth-lehem."
7163,wbt,And Jacob set a pillar on her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.
7164,wbt,"And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar."
7165,wbt,"And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:"
7166,wbt,"The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:"
7167,wbt,"The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:"
7168,wbt,"And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:"
7169,wbt,"And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Padan-aram."
7170,wbt,"And Jacob came to Isaac his father to Mamre, to the city of Arbah (which is Hebron) where Abraham and Isaac sojourned."
7171,wbt,And the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years.
7172,wbt,"And Isaac expired and died, and was gathered to his people, being old and full of days; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him."
7173,wbt,"Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom."
7174,wbt,"Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;"
7175,wbt,"And Bashemath, Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth."
7176,wbt,"And Adah bore to Esau, Eliphaz; and Bashemath bore Reuel;"
7177,wbt,"And Aholibamah bore Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: These are the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan."
7178,wbt,"And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance which he had acquired in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob."
7179,wbt,"For their riches were more than that they might dwell together: and the land wherein they were strangers could not sustain them, because of their cattle."
7180,wbt,Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.
7181,wbt,"And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites, in mount Seir:"
7182,wbt,"These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau."
7183,wbt,"And the sons of Eliphaz were, Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz."
7184,wbt,And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.
7185,wbt,"And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife."
7186,wbt,"And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon Esau's wife: and she bore to Esau, Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah."
7187,wbt,"These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the first-born son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,"
7188,wbt,"Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes, descendants of Eliphaz, in the land of Edom: these were the sons of Adah."
7189,wbt,"And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes, descendants of Reuel, in the land of Edom: these are the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife."
7190,wbt,"And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes, descendants of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah Esau's wife."
7191,wbt,These are the sons of Esau (who is Edom) and these are their dukes.
7192,wbt,"These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah."
7193,wbt,"And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom."
7194,wbt,"And the children of Lotan were Hori, and Heman: and Lotan's sister was Timna."
7195,wbt,"And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam."
7196,wbt,"And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah and Anah; this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father."
7197,wbt,"And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah."
7198,wbt,"And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran."
7199,wbt,"The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Achan."
7200,wbt,"The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran."
7201,wbt,"These are the dukes, descendants of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,"
7202,wbt,"Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan; these are the dukes, descendants of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir."
7203,wbt,"And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel."
7204,wbt,And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah.
7205,wbt,"And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead."
7206,wbt,"And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead."
7207,wbt,"And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad (who smote Midian in the field of Moab) reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith."
7208,wbt,"And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead."
7209,wbt,"And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead."
7210,wbt,"And Saul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead."
7211,wbt,"And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead; and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab."
7212,wbt,"And these are the names of the dukes, descendants of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,"
7213,wbt,"Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,"
7214,wbt,"Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar."
7215,wbt,"Duke Magdiel, duke Iram; these are the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations, in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites."
7216,wbt,"And Jacob dwelt in the land in which his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan."
7217,wbt,"These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought to his father their evil report."
7218,wbt,"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors."
7219,wbt,"And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him."
7220,wbt,"And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren: and they hated him yet the more."
7221,wbt,"And he said to them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:"
7222,wbt,"For behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves stood around and made obeisance to my sheaf."
7223,wbt,"And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words."
7224,wbt,"And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more: and behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me."
7225,wbt,"And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said to him, what is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?"
7226,wbt,And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
7227,wbt,And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
7228,wbt,"And Israel said to Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send thee to them. And he said to him, Here am I."
7229,wbt,"And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him from the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem."
7230,wbt,"And a certain man found him, and behold he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?"
7231,wbt,"And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks."
7232,wbt,"And the man said, They have departed hence: for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren and found them in Dothan."
7233,wbt,"And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near to them, they conspired against him to slay him."
7234,wbt,"And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer is coming."
7235,wbt,"Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit; and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him; and we shall see what will become of his dreams."
7236,wbt,"And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him from their hands: and said, Let us not kill him."
7237,wbt,"And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might deliver him from their hands, to bring him back to his father."
7238,wbt,"And it came to pass when Joseph had come to his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, his coat of many colors that was on him."
7239,wbt,"And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty; there was no water in it."
7240,wbt,"And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery, and balm, and myrrh, going to carry them down to Egypt."
7241,wbt,"And Judah said to his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood."
7242,wbt,"Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh: and his brethren were content."
7243,wbt,"Then there passed by Midianites, merchants; and they drew and lifted Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt."
7244,wbt,"And Reuben returned to the pit; and behold, Joseph was not in the pit: and he rent his clothes."
7245,wbt,"And he returned to his brethren, and said, The child is not: and I, whither shall I go?"
7246,wbt,"And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood:"
7247,wbt,"And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it is thy son's coat or not."
7248,wbt,"And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him: Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces."
7249,wbt,"And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days."
7250,wbt,"And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave to my son mourning: Thus his father wept for him."
7251,wbt,"And the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard."
7252,wbt,"And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah."
7253,wbt,"And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in to her."
7254,wbt,"And she conceived, and bore a son; and he called his name Er."
7255,wbt,"And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she called his name Onan."
7256,wbt,"And she yet again conceived, and bore a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him."
7257,wbt,"And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, whose name was Tamar."
7258,wbt,"And Er, Judah's first-born, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him."
7259,wbt,"And Judah said to Onan, Go in to thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother."
7260,wbt,"And Onan knew that the seed would not be his: and it came to pass, when he went in to his brother's wife, that he frustrated the purpose, lest he should give seed to his brother."
7261,wbt,And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.
7262,wbt,"Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son shall be grown; (for he said, Lest perhaps he die also as his brethren did:) and Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house."
7263,wbt,"And in process of time, the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died: and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep-shearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite."
7264,wbt,"And it was told to Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnath, to shear his sheep."
7265,wbt,"And she put off from her, her widow's garments, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath: for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him for a wife."
7266,wbt,"When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; because she had covered her face."
7267,wbt,"And he turned to her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me have access to thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law:) and she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayst have access to me?"
7268,wbt,"And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock: and she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou sendest it?"
7269,wbt,"And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? and she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thy hand: and he gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him."
7270,wbt,"And she arose and went her way and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood."
7271,wbt,"And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not."
7272,wbt,"Then he asked the men of that place, saying, where is the harlot that was openly by the way-side? and they said, There was no harlot in this place."
7273,wbt,"And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place."
7274,wbt,"And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her."
7275,wbt,"And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told to Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and also, behold she is with child by lewdness: and Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt."
7276,wbt,"When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff."
7277,wbt,"And Judah acknowledged them, and said She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son: and he knew her again no more."
7278,wbt,"And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that behold, twins were in her womb."
7279,wbt,"And it came to pass when she travailed, that the one put out his hand; and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first."
7280,wbt,"And it came to pass as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out; and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez."
7281,wbt,And afterwards came out his brother that had the scarlet thread upon his hand; and his name was called Zarah.
7282,wbt,"And Joseph was brought down to Egypt: and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down thither."
7283,wbt,"And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man: and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian."
7284,wbt,"And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand."
7285,wbt,"And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand."
7286,wbt,"And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake: and the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had in the house, and in the field."
7287,wbt,"And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not aught he had, save the bread which he ate; and Joseph was a goodly person, and well favored."
7288,wbt,"And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph: and she said, Lie with me."
7289,wbt,"But he refused, and said to his master's wife, Behold, my master knoweth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand:"
7290,wbt,"There is none greater in his house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"
7291,wbt,"And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not to her, to lie by her, or to be with her."
7292,wbt,"And it came to pass, about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within."
7293,wbt,"And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and went out."
7294,wbt,"And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had fled forth,"
7295,wbt,"That she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, See, he hath brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us: he came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:"
7296,wbt,"And it came to pass, when he heard that I raised my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and went out."
7297,wbt,And she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home.
7298,wbt,"And she spoke to him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought to us, came in to me to mock me."
7299,wbt,"And it came to pass, as I raised my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled."
7300,wbt,"And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled."
7301,wbt,"And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison."
7302,wbt,"But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison."
7303,wbt,"And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatever they did there, was done by him."
7304,wbt,The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him: and that which he did the LORD made it to prosper.
7305,wbt,"And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt."
7306,wbt,"And Pharaoh was wroth with two of his officers, with the chief of the butlers, and with the chief of the bakers."
7307,wbt,"And he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound."
7308,wbt,"And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them; and they continued a season in custody."
7309,wbt,"And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream; the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison."
7310,wbt,"And Joseph came to them in the morning, and looked upon them, and behold, they were sad."
7311,wbt,"And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Why look ye so sad to-day?"
7312,wbt,"And they said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you."
7313,wbt,"And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;"
7314,wbt,"And on the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and its blossoms shot forth; and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes:"
7315,wbt,"And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand."
7316,wbt,"And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days;"
7317,wbt,"Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee to thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler."
7318,wbt,"But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness to me, I pray thee, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:"
7319,wbt,For indeed I was stolen away from the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
7320,wbt,"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also was in my dream, and behold, I had three white baskets on my head:"
7321,wbt,And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bake-meats for Pharaoh; and the birds ate them out of the basket upon my head.
7322,wbt,"And Joseph answered, and said, This is the interpretation of it: The three baskets are three days:"
7323,wbt,"Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee."
7324,wbt,"And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birth-day, that he made a feast to all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants."
7325,wbt,And he restored the chief butler to his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:
7326,wbt,But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
7327,wbt,"Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him."
7328,wbt,"And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and behold, he stood by the river."
7329,wbt,"And behold, there came up out of the river seven well-favored cows and fat-fleshed; and they fed in a meadow."
7330,wbt,"And behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed; and stood by the other cows upon the brink of the river."
7331,wbt,And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed cows ate up the seven well-favored and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.
7332,wbt,"And he slept and dreamed the second time: and behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good."
7333,wbt,"And behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them."
7334,wbt,"And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream."
7335,wbt,"And it came to pass in the morning, that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them to Pharaoh."
7336,wbt,"Then spoke the chief butler to Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:"
7337,wbt,"Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in custody in the captain of the guard's house, both me, and the chief baker:"
7338,wbt,"And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he: we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream."
7339,wbt,"And there was there with us a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he interpreted."
7340,wbt,"And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was: me he restored to my office, and him he hanged."
7341,wbt,"Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came before Pharaoh."
7342,wbt,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard it said of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it."
7343,wbt,"And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace."
7344,wbt,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:"
7345,wbt,"And behold, there came out of the river seven cows, fat-fleshed, and well-favored; and they fed in a meadow:"
7346,wbt,"And behold, seven other cows came out after them, poor, and very ill-favored, and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:"
7347,wbt,And the lean and the ill-favored cows ate up the first seven fat cows:
7348,wbt,"And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke."
7349,wbt,"And I saw in my dream, and behold, seven ears came up on one stalk, full and good:"
7350,wbt,"And behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:"
7351,wbt,And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this to the magicians; but there was none that could explain it to me.
7352,wbt,"And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one; God hath showed Pharaoh what he is about to do."
7353,wbt,The seven good cows are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.
7354,wbt,And the seven thin and ill-favored cows that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind will be seven years of famine.
7355,wbt,This is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh: What God is about to do he showeth to Pharaoh.
7356,wbt,"Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:"
7357,wbt,And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
7358,wbt,And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of the famine following: for it will be very grievous.
7359,wbt,"And for that the dream was doubled to Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass."
7360,wbt,"Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt."
7361,wbt,"Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years."
7362,wbt,"And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh; and let them keep food in the cities."
7363,wbt,"And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land may not perish through the famine."
7364,wbt,"And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants."
7365,wbt,"And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find such a man as this is, a man in whom the spirit of God is?"
7366,wbt,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shown thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:"
7367,wbt,"Thou shalt be over my house, and according to thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou."
7368,wbt,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt."
7369,wbt,"And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;"
7370,wbt,"And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had: and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt."
7371,wbt,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt."
7372,wbt,And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him for a wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On: and Joseph went over all the land of Egypt.
7373,wbt,"And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt: and Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt."
7374,wbt,And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfulls.
7375,wbt,"And he gathered all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field which was around every city, he laid up in the same."
7376,wbt,"And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number."
7377,wbt,And to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came: which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bore to him.
7378,wbt,"And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house."
7379,wbt,And the name of the second called he Ephraim: for God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
7380,wbt,"And the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of Egypt, were ended."
7381,wbt,"And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread."
7382,wbt,"And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; what he saith to you, do."
7383,wbt,"And the famine was over all the face of the earth; and Joseph opened all the store-houses, and sold to the Egyptians; and the famine became severe in the land of Egypt."
7384,wbt,And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy corn; because the famine was distressing in all lands.
7385,wbt,"Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?"
7386,wbt,"And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: go down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die."
7387,wbt,And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
7388,wbt,"But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren: for he said, Lest perhaps mischief shall befall him."
7389,wbt,And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
7390,wbt,"And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the earth."
7391,wbt,"And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange to them, and spoke roughly to them; and he said to them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food."
7392,wbt,"And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him."
7393,wbt,"And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said to them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land have ye come."
7394,wbt,"And they said to him, No, my lord, but to buy food have thy servants come."
7395,wbt,We are all one man's sons; we are true men; thy servants are no spies.
7396,wbt,"And he said to them, No, but to see the nakedness of the land have ye come."
7397,wbt,"And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not."
7398,wbt,"And Joseph said to them, That is what I spoke to you, saying, Ye are spies:"
7399,wbt,"By this ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother shall come hither."
7400,wbt,"Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there is any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies."
7401,wbt,And he put them all together into custody three days.
7402,wbt,"And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:"
7403,wbt,"If ye are true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:"
7404,wbt,"But bring your youngest brother to me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so."
7405,wbt,"And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us."
7406,wbt,"And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Do not sin against the young man; and ye would not hear? therefore behold also his blood is required."
7407,wbt,And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spoke to them by an interpreter.
7408,wbt,"And he turned himself away from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes."
7409,wbt,"Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he to them."
7410,wbt,"And they loaded their asses with the corn, and departed thence."
7411,wbt,"And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money: for behold, it was in his sack's mouth."
7412,wbt,"And he said to his brethren, My money is restored; and see it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done to us?"
7413,wbt,"And they came to Jacob their father to the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell them, saying,"
7414,wbt,"The man who is the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country."
7415,wbt,"And we said to him, We are true men; we are no spies:"
7416,wbt,"We are twelve brethren, sons of our father: one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan."
7417,wbt,"And the man, the lord of the country, said to us, By this shall I know that ye are true men: leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and depart:"
7418,wbt,"And bring your youngest brother to me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: then will I deliver to you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land."
7419,wbt,"And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid."
7420,wbt,"And Jacob their father said to them, Me have ye bereaved: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me."
7421,wbt,"And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again."
7422,wbt,"And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief shall befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."
7423,wbt,\43:1\And the famine was severe in the land.
7424,wbt,"\43:2\And it came to pass, when they had consumed the corn which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, Go again, buy us a little food."
7425,wbt,"\43:3\And Judah spoke to him, saying, The man did solemnly protest to us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you."
7426,wbt,"\43:4\If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:"
7427,wbt,"\43:5\But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you."
7428,wbt,"\43:6\And Israel said, Why dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?"
7429,wbt,"\43:7\And they said, The man asked us strictly concerning our state, and our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: Could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?"
7430,wbt,"\43:8\And Judah said to Israel, his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones."
7431,wbt,"\43:9\I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not to thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:"
7432,wbt,"\43:10\For except we had delayed, surely now we had returned this second time."
7433,wbt,"\43:11\And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry to the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:"
7434,wbt,"\43:12\And take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; it may be it was an oversight:"
7435,wbt,"\43:13\Take also your brother, and arise, go again to the man:"
7436,wbt,"\43:14\And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin: If I be bereaved, I am bereaved."
7437,wbt,"\43:15\And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and arose, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph."
7438,wbt,"\43:16\And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready: for these men shall dine with me at noon."
7439,wbt,\43:17\And the man did as Joseph commanded: and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
7440,wbt,"\43:18\And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time, are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bond-men, and our asses."
7441,wbt,"\43:19\And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,"
7442,wbt,"\43:20\And said, O sir, we came down indeed at the first time to buy food:"
7443,wbt,"\43:21\And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand."
7444,wbt,\43:22\And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.
7445,wbt,"\43:23\And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out to them."
7446,wbt,"\43:24\And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender."
7447,wbt,\43:25\And they made ready the present against Joseph should come at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
7448,wbt,"\43:26\And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth."
7449,wbt,"\43:27\And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spoke? Is he yet alive?"
7450,wbt,"\43:28\And they answered, Thy servant, our father, is in good health, he is yet alive: and they bowed their heads and made obeisance."
7451,wbt,"\43:29\And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to thee, my son."
7452,wbt,"\43:30\And Joseph made haste; for his bowels yearned towards his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there."
7453,wbt,"\43:31\And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread."
7454,wbt,"\43:32\And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who ate with him, by themselves; because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination to the Egyptians."
7455,wbt,"\43:33\And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birth-right, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men wondered one at another."
7456,wbt,"\43:34\And he took and sent messes to them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him."
7457,wbt,"And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth."
7458,wbt,"And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money: and he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken."
7459,wbt,"As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they, and their asses."
7460,wbt,"And when they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, Arise, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say to them, Why have ye rewarded evil for good?"
7461,wbt,"Is not this the cup in which my lord drinketh, and by which indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing."
7462,wbt,"And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words."
7463,wbt,"And they said to him, Why saith my lord these words? Far be it from us that thy servants should do according to this thing:"
7464,wbt,"Behold, the money which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again to thee from the land of Canaan: how then should we steal from thy lord's house silver or gold?"
7465,wbt,"With whom soever of thy servants it shall be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bond-men."
7466,wbt,"And he said, Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it shall be found, shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless."
7467,wbt,"Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack."
7468,wbt,"And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack."
7469,wbt,"Then they rent their clothes, and loaded every man his ass, and returned to the city."
7470,wbt,"And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house, (for he was yet there:) and they fell before him on the ground."
7471,wbt,"And Joseph said to them, What deed is this that ye have done? knew ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?"
7472,wbt,"And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found."
7473,wbt,"And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, go in peace to your father."
7474,wbt,"Then Judah came near to him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thy anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh."
7475,wbt,"My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?"
7476,wbt,"And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one: and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him."
7477,wbt,"And thou saidst to thy servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes upon him."
7478,wbt,"And we said to my lord, The lad cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, his father would die."
7479,wbt,"And thou saidst to thy servants, Except your youngest brother shall come down with you, ye shall see my face no more."
7480,wbt,"And it came to pass, when we came to thy servant, my father, we told him the words of my lord."
7481,wbt,"And our father said, Go again; buy us a little food."
7482,wbt,"And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother shall be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother shall be with us."
7483,wbt,"And thy servant my father, said to us, Ye know that my wife bore me two sons:"
7484,wbt,"And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since:"
7485,wbt,"And if ye take this also from me, and mischief shall befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."
7486,wbt,"Now therefore, when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; (seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life)"
7487,wbt,"It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father, with sorrow to the grave."
7488,wbt,"For thy servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I bring him not to thee, then I will bear the blame to my father for ever."
7489,wbt,"Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad, a bond-man to my lord; and let the lad return with his brethren."
7490,wbt,"For how shall I return to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest perhaps I see the evil that shall come on my father."
7491,wbt,"Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me: and there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known to his brethren."
7492,wbt,And he wept aloud; and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
7493,wbt,"And Joseph said to his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence."
7494,wbt,"And Joseph said to his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you: and they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt."
7495,wbt,"Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither; for God sent me before you to preserve life."
7496,wbt,"For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in which there shall neither be tillage nor harvest."
7497,wbt,"And God sent me before you, to preserve for you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance."
7498,wbt,"So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt."
7499,wbt,"Haste ye, and return to my father, and say to him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me; delay not:"
7500,wbt,"And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near to me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:"
7501,wbt,"And there will I nourish thee, (for yet there are five years of famine,) lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, should come to poverty."
7502,wbt,"And behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh to you."
7503,wbt,"And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen: and ye shall haste, and bring down my father hither."
7504,wbt,"And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck."
7505,wbt,"Moreover, he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him."
7506,wbt,"And the fame of this was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants."
7507,wbt,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to thy brethren, This do ye; load your beasts, and go, return to the land of Canaan;"
7508,wbt,"And take your father, and your households, and come to me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land."
7509,wbt,"Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take for yourselves wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come."
7510,wbt,Also regard not your furniture; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.
7511,wbt,"And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way."
7512,wbt,"To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment: but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment."
7513,wbt,"And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with corn and bread and meat, for his father by the way."
7514,wbt,"So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said to them, See that ye contend not by the way."
7515,wbt,"And they went up from Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father,"
7516,wbt,"And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not."
7517,wbt,"And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:"
7518,wbt,"And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die."
7519,wbt,"And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac."
7520,wbt,"And God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob: and he said, Here am I."
7521,wbt,"And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:"
7522,wbt,I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
7523,wbt,"And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him."
7524,wbt,"And they took their cattle, and their goods which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:"
7525,wbt,"His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt."
7526,wbt,"And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's first-born."
7527,wbt,"And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi."
7528,wbt,"And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman."
7529,wbt,"And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
7530,wbt,"And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zerah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron, and Hamul."
7531,wbt,"And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron."
7532,wbt,"And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel."
7533,wbt,"These are the sons of Leah, which she bore to Jacob in Padan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three."
7534,wbt,"And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggai, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli."
7535,wbt,"And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister. And the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel."
7536,wbt,"These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter: and these she bore to Jacob, even sixteen souls."
7537,wbt,"The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin."
7538,wbt,"And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bore to him."
7539,wbt,"And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard."
7540,wbt,"These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob; all the souls were fourteen."
7541,wbt,And the sons of Dan; Hushim.
7542,wbt,"And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem."
7543,wbt,"These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and she bore these to Jacob: all the souls were seven."
7544,wbt,"All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, who came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were sixty and six."
7545,wbt,"And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, who came into Egypt, were seventy."
7546,wbt,"And he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to direct his face to Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen."
7547,wbt,"And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went to meet Israel his father to Goshen; and presented himself to him: and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while."
7548,wbt,"And Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive."
7549,wbt,"And Joseph said to his brethren, and to his father's house, I will go up, and show Pharaoh, and say to him, My brethren, and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan are come to me."
7550,wbt,"And the men are shepherds, for their employment hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have."
7551,wbt,"And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?"
7552,wbt,"That ye shall say, The occupation of thy servants hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians."
7553,wbt,"Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, have come from the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen."
7554,wbt,"And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them to Pharaoh."
7555,wbt,"And Pharaoh said to his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers."
7556,wbt,"They said moreover to Pharaoh, We have come to sojourn in the land: for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen."
7557,wbt,"And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren have come to thee:"
7558,wbt,"The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell; and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle."
7559,wbt,"And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh."
7560,wbt,"And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How old art thou?"
7561,wbt,"And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, nor have they attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage."
7562,wbt,"And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh."
7563,wbt,"And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded."
7564,wbt,"And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread according to their families."
7565,wbt,"And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very distressing, so that the land of Egypt, and all the land of Canaan, fainted by reason of the famine."
7566,wbt,"And Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house."
7567,wbt,"And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence: for the money faileth."
7568,wbt,"And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money hath failed."
7569,wbt,"And they brought their cattle to Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses; and he fed them with bread, for all their cattle, for that year."
7570,wbt,"When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not aught left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies and our lands:"
7571,wbt,"Why shall we die before thy eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate."
7572,wbt,"And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's."
7573,wbt,"And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof."
7574,wbt,"Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them by Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands."
7575,wbt,"Then Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land."
7576,wbt,"And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones."
7577,wbt,"And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants."
7578,wbt,"And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's."
7579,wbt,"And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions in it and grew, and multiplied exceedingly."
7580,wbt,And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was a hundred and forty seven years.
7581,wbt,"And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:"
7582,wbt,"But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as thou hast said."
7583,wbt,"And he said, Swear to me: and he swore to him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head."
7584,wbt,"And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim."
7585,wbt,"And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh to thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed."
7586,wbt,"And Jacob said to Joseph, God Almighty appeared to me at Luz, in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,"
7587,wbt,"And said to me, Behold I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee, for an everlasting possession."
7588,wbt,"And now, thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt, before I came to thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine."
7589,wbt,"And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance."
7590,wbt,"And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan, in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath, the same is Beth-lehem."
7591,wbt,"And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?"
7592,wbt,"And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, to me, and I will bless them."
7593,wbt,"(Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see:) And he brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them."
7594,wbt,"And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and lo, God hath shown me also thy seed."
7595,wbt,"And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth."
7596,wbt,"And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand towards Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand towards Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him."
7597,wbt,"And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands by design; for Manasseh was the first-born."
7598,wbt,"And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who hath fed me all my life long to this day,"
7599,wbt,"The angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac: and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."
7600,wbt,"And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he lifted his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head."
7601,wbt,"And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father; for this is the first-born; put thy right hand upon his head."
7602,wbt,"And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it; he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations."
7603,wbt,"And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh."
7604,wbt,"And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die; but God shall be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers."
7605,wbt,"Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow."
7606,wbt,"And Jacob called to his sons, and said, Assemble yourselves, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days."
7607,wbt,"Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob: and hearken to Israel your father."
7608,wbt,"Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellence of dignity, and the excellence of power:"
7609,wbt,"Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it; he went up to my couch."
7610,wbt,"Simeon and Levi are brethren: instruments of cruelty are in, their habitations."
7611,wbt,"O my soul, come not thou into their secret; to their assembly, my honor, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they digged down a wall."
7612,wbt,"Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce: and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel."
7613,wbt,"Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise; thy hand shall be on the neck of thy enemies: thy father's children shall bow down before thee."
7614,wbt,"Judah is a lion's whelp; from the prey, my son, thou hast gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion: who shall rouse him up?"
7615,wbt,"The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh shall come: and to him shall be the gathering of the people."
7616,wbt,"Binding his foal to the vine, and his ass's colt to the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:"
7617,wbt,"His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk."
7618,wbt,Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for a haven of ships; and his border shall be to Zidon.
7619,wbt,"Issachar is a strong ass, couching down between two burdens:"
7620,wbt,"And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant to tribute."
7621,wbt,"Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel."
7622,wbt,"Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse-heels, so that his rider shall fall backward."
7623,wbt,I have waited for thy salvation O LORD.
7624,wbt,"Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last."
7625,wbt,"Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties."
7626,wbt,Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.
7627,wbt,"Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:"
7628,wbt,"The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:"
7629,wbt,"But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob: from thence is the shepherd the stone of Israel:"
7630,wbt,"Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth beneath, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:"
7631,wbt,"The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills; they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren."
7632,wbt,"Benjamin shall raven as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil."
7633,wbt,"All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it which their father spoke to them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them."
7634,wbt,"And he charged them, and said to them, I am to be gathered to my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite."
7635,wbt,"In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burying-place."
7636,wbt,"(There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah,)"
7637,wbt,"The purchase of the field and of the cave that is in it, was from the children of Heth."
7638,wbt,"And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he drew his feet into the bed, and expired, and was gathered to his people."
7639,wbt,"And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him."
7640,wbt,And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
7641,wbt,And forty days were fulfilled for him; (for so are fulfilled the days of those who are embalmed:) and the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.
7642,wbt,"And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,"
7643,wbt,"My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again."
7644,wbt,"And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear."
7645,wbt,"And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,"
7646,wbt,"And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds they left in the land of Goshen."
7647,wbt,And there went with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
7648,wbt,"And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days."
7649,wbt,"And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond Jordan."
7650,wbt,And his sons did to him according as he commanded them:
7651,wbt,"For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying-place of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre."

9222,ylt,"And God maketh the beast of the earth after its kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, and God seeth that `it is' good."
9223,ylt,"And God saith, `Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness, and let them rule over fish of the sea, and over fowl of the heavens, and over cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that is creeping on the earth.'"
9224,ylt,"And God prepareth the man in His image; in the image of God He prepared him, a male and a female He prepared them."
9225,ylt,"And God blesseth them, and God saith to them, `Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over fish of the sea, and over fowl of the heavens, and over every living thing that is creeping upon the earth.'"
9226,ylt,"And God saith, `Lo, I have given to you every herb sowing seed, which `is' upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in which `is' the fruit of a tree sowing seed, to you it is for food;"
9227,ylt,"and to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the heavens, and to every creeping thing on the earth, in which `is' breath of life, every green herb `is' for food:' and it is so."
9228,ylt,"And God seeth all that He hath done, and lo, very good; and there is an evening, and there is a morning -- day the sixth."
9229,ylt,"And the heavens and the earth are completed, and all their host;"
9230,ylt,"and God completeth by the seventh day His work which He hath made, and ceaseth by the seventh day from all His work which He hath made."
9231,ylt,"And God blesseth the seventh day, and sanctifieth it, for in it He hath ceased from all His work which God had prepared for making."
9232,ylt,"These `are' births of the heavens and of the earth in their being prepared, in the day of Jehovah God's making earth and heavens;"
9233,ylt,"and no shrub of the field is yet in the earth, and no herb of the field yet sprouteth, for Jehovah God hath not rained upon the earth, and a man there is not to serve the ground,"
9234,ylt,"and a mist goeth up from the earth, and hath watered the whole face of the ground."
9235,ylt,"And Jehovah God formeth the man -- dust from the ground, and breatheth into his nostrils breath of life, and the man becometh a living creature."
9236,ylt,"And Jehovah God planteth a garden in Eden, at the east, and He setteth there the man whom He hath formed;"
9237,ylt,"and Jehovah God causeth to sprout from the ground every tree desirable for appearance, and good for food, and the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil."
9238,ylt,"And a river is going out from Eden to water the garden, and from thence it is parted, and hath become four chief `rivers';"
9239,ylt,"the name of the one `is' Pison, it `is' that which is surrounding the whole land of the Havilah where the gold `is',"
9240,ylt,"and the gold of that land `is' good, there `is' the bdolach and the shoham stone;"
9241,ylt,"and the name of the second river `is' Gibon, it `is' that which is surrounding the whole land of Cush;"
9242,ylt,"and the name of the third river `is' Hiddekel, it `is' that which is going east of Asshur; and the fourth river is Phrat."
9243,ylt,"And Jehovah God taketh the man, and causeth him to rest in the garden of Eden, to serve it, and to keep it."
9244,ylt,"And Jehovah God layeth a charge on the man, saying, `Of every tree of the garden eating thou dost eat;"
9245,ylt,"and of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou dost not eat of it, for in the day of thine eating of it -- dying thou dost die.'"
9246,ylt,"And Jehovah God saith, `Not good for the man to be alone, I do make to him an helper -- as his counterpart.'"
9247,ylt,"And Jehovah God formeth from the ground every beast of the field, and every fowl of the heavens, and bringeth in unto the man, to see what he doth call it; and whatever the man calleth a living creature, that `is' its name."
9248,ylt,"And the man calleth names to all the cattle, and to fowl of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; and to man hath not been found an helper -- as his counterpart."
9249,ylt,"And Jehovah God causeth a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he sleepeth, and He taketh one of his ribs, and closeth up flesh in its stead."
9250,ylt,"And Jehovah God buildeth up the rib which He hath taken out of the man into a woman, and bringeth her in unto the man;"
9251,ylt,"and the man saith, `This `is' the `proper' step! bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh!' for this it is called Woman, for from a man hath this been taken;"
9252,ylt,"therefore doth a man leave his father and his mother, and hath cleaved unto his wife, and they have become one flesh."
9253,ylt,"And they are both of them naked, the man and his wife, and they are not ashamed of themselves."
9254,ylt,"And the serpent hath been subtile above every beast of the field which Jehovah God hath made, and he saith unto the woman, `Is it true that God hath said, Ye do not eat of every tree of the garden?'"
9255,ylt,"And the woman saith unto the serpent, `Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we do eat,"
9256,ylt,"and of the fruit of the tree which `is' in the midst of the garden God hath said, Ye do not eat of it, nor touch it, lest ye die.'"
9257,ylt,"And the serpent saith unto the woman, `Dying, ye do not die,"
9258,ylt,"for God doth know that in the day of your eating of it -- your eyes have been opened, and ye have been as God, knowing good and evil.'"
9259,ylt,"And the woman seeth that the tree `is' good for food, and that it `is' pleasant to the eyes, and the tree is desirable to make `one' wise, and she taketh of its fruit and eateth, and giveth also to her husband with her, and he doth eat;"
9260,ylt,"and the eyes of them both are opened, and they know that they `are' naked, and they sew fig-leaves, and make to themselves girdles."
9261,ylt,"And they hear the sound of Jehovah God walking up and down in the garden at the breeze of the day, and the man and his wife hide themselves from the face of Jehovah God in the midst of the trees of the garden."
9262,ylt,"And Jehovah God calleth unto the man, and saith to him, `Where `art' thou?'"
9263,ylt,"and he saith, `Thy sound I have heard in the garden, and I am afraid, for I am naked, and I hide myself.'"
9264,ylt,"And He saith, `Who hath declared to thee that thou `art' naked? of the tree of which I have commanded thee not to eat, hast thou eaten?'"
9265,ylt,"and the man saith, `The woman whom Thou didst place with me -- she hath given to me of the tree -- and I do eat.'"
9266,ylt,"And Jehovah God saith to the woman, `What `is' this thou hast done?' and the woman saith, `The serpent hath caused me to forget -- and I do eat.'"
9267,ylt,"And Jehovah God saith unto the serpent, `Because thou hast done this, cursed `art' thou above all the cattle, and above every beast of the field: on thy belly dost thou go, and dust thou dost eat, all days of thy life;"
9268,ylt,"and enmity I put between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; he doth bruise thee -- the head, and thou dost bruise him -- the heel.'"
9269,ylt,"Unto the woman He said, `Multiplying I multiply thy sorrow and thy conception, in sorrow dost thou bear children, and toward thy husband `is' thy desire, and he doth rule over thee.'"
9270,ylt,"And to the man He said, `Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and dost eat of the tree concerning which I have charged thee, saying, Thou dost not eat of it, cursed `is' the ground on thine account; in sorrow thou dost eat of it all days of thy life,"
9271,ylt,"and thorn and bramble it doth bring forth to thee, and thou hast eaten the herb of the field;"
9272,ylt,"by the sweat of thy face thou dost eat bread till thy return unto the ground, for out of it hast thou been taken, for dust thou `art', and unto dust thou turnest back.'"
9273,ylt,And the man calleth his wife's name Eve: for she hath been mother of all living.
9274,ylt,"And Jehovah God doth make to the man and to his wife coats of skin, and doth clothe them."
9275,ylt,"And Jehovah God saith, `Lo, the man was as one of Us, as to the knowledge of good and evil; and now, lest he send forth his hand, and have taken also of the tree of life, and eaten, and lived to the age,' --"
9276,ylt,Jehovah God sendeth him forth from the garden of Eden to serve the ground from which he hath been taken;
9277,ylt,"yea, he casteth out the man, and causeth to dwell at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubs and the flame of the sword which is turning itself round to guard the way of the tree of life."
9278,ylt,"And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceiveth and beareth Cain, and saith, `I have gotten a man by Jehovah;'"
9279,ylt,"and she addeth to bear his brother, even Abel. And Abel is feeding a flock, and Cain hath been servant of the ground."
9280,ylt,And it cometh to pass at the end of days that Cain bringeth from the fruit of the ground a present to Jehovah;
9281,ylt,"and Abel, he hath brought, he also, from the female firstlings of his flock, even from their fat ones; and Jehovah looketh unto Abel and unto his present,"
9282,ylt,"and unto Cain and unto his present He hath not looked; and it is very displeasing to Cain, and his countenance is fallen."
9283,ylt,"And Jehovah saith unto Cain, `Why hast thou displeasure? and why hath thy countenance fallen?"
9284,ylt,"Is there not, if thou dost well, acceptance? and if thou dost not well, at the opening a sin-offering is crouching, and unto thee its desire, and thou rulest over it.'"
9285,ylt,"And Cain saith unto Abel his brother, ``Let us go into the field;'' and it cometh to pass in their being in the field, that Cain riseth up against Abel his brother, and slayeth him."
9286,ylt,"And Jehovah saith unto Cain, `Where `is' Abel thy brother?' and he saith, `I have not known; my brother's keeper -- I?'"
9287,ylt,"And He saith, `What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood is crying unto Me from the ground;"
9288,ylt,"and now, cursed `art' thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive the blood of thy brother from thy hand;"
9289,ylt,"when thou tillest the ground, it doth not add to give its strength to thee -- a wanderer, even a trembling one, thou art in the earth.'"
9290,ylt,"And Cain saith unto Jehovah, `Greater is my punishment than to be borne;"
9291,ylt,"lo, Thou hast driven me to-day from off the face of the ground, and from Thy face I am hid; and I have been a wanderer, even a trembling one, in the earth, and it hath been -- every one finding me doth slay me.'"
9292,ylt,"And Jehovah saith to him, `Therefore -- of any slayer of Cain sevenfold it is required;' and Jehovah setteth to Cain a token that none finding him doth slay him."
9293,ylt,"And Cain goeth out from before Jehovah, and dwelleth in the land, moving about east of Eden;"
9294,ylt,"and Cain knoweth his wife, and she conceiveth, and beareth Enoch; and he is building a city, and he calleth the name of the city, according to the name of his son -- Enoch."
9295,ylt,And born to Enoch is Irad; and Irad hath begotten Mehujael; and Mehujael hath begotten Methusael; and Methusael hath begotten Lamech.
9296,ylt,"And Lamech taketh to himself two wives, the name of the one Adah, and the name of the second Zillah."
9297,ylt,"And Adah beareth Jabal, he hath been father of those inhabiting tents and purchased possessions;"
9298,ylt,"and the name of his brother `is' Jubal, he hath been father of every one handling harp and organ."
9299,ylt,"And Zillah she also bare Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron; and a sister of Tubal-Cain `is' Naamah."
9300,ylt,"And Lamech saith to his wives: -- `Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Wives of Lamech, give ear `to' my saying: For a man I have slain for my wound, Even a young man for my hurt;"
9301,ylt,"For sevenfold is required for Cain, And for Lamech seventy and sevenfold.'"
9302,ylt,"And Adam again knoweth his wife, and she beareth a son, and calleth his name Seth, `for God hath appointed for me another seed instead of Abel:' for Cain had slain him."
9303,ylt,"And to Seth, to him also a son hath been born, and he calleth his name Enos; then a beginning was made of preaching in the name of Jehovah."
9304,ylt,"This `is' an account of the births of Adam: In the day of God's preparing man, in the likeness of God He hath made him;"
9305,ylt,"a male and a female He hath prepared them, and He blesseth them, and calleth their name Man, in the day of their being prepared."
9306,ylt,"And Adam liveth an hundred and thirty years, and begetteth `a son' in his likeness, according to his image, and calleth his name Seth."
9307,ylt,"And the days of Adam after his begetting Seth are eight hundred years, and he begetteth sons and daughters."
9308,ylt,"And all the days of Adam which he lived are nine hundred and thirty years, and he dieth."
9309,ylt,"And Seth liveth an hundred and five years, and begetteth Enos."
9310,ylt,"And Seth liveth after his begetting Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
9311,ylt,"And all the days of Seth are nine hundred and twelve years, and he dieth."
9312,ylt,"And Enos liveth ninety years, and begetteth Cainan."
9313,ylt,"And Enos liveth after his begetting Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
9314,ylt,"And all the days of Enos are nine hundred and five years, and he dieth."
9315,ylt,"And Cainan liveth seventy years, and begetteth Mahalaleel."
9316,ylt,"And Cainan liveth after his begetting Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
9317,ylt,"And all the days of Cainan are nine hundred and ten years, and he dieth."
9318,ylt,"And Mahalaleel liveth five and sixty years, and begetteth Jared."
9319,ylt,"And Mahalaleel liveth after his begetting Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
9320,ylt,"And all the days of Mahalaleel are eight hundred and ninety and five years, and he dieth."
9321,ylt,"And Jared liveth an hundred and sixty and two years, and begetteth Enoch."
9322,ylt,"And Jared liveth after his begetting Enoch eight hundred years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
9323,ylt,"And all the days of Jared are nine hundred and sixty and two years, and he dieth."
9324,ylt,"And Enoch liveth five and sixty years, and begetteth Methuselah."
9325,ylt,"And Enoch walketh habitually with God after his begetting Methuselah three hundred years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
9326,ylt,And all the days of Enoch are three hundred and sixty and five years.
9327,ylt,"And Enoch walketh habitually with God, and he is not, for God hath taken him."
9328,ylt,"And Methuselah liveth an hundred and eighty and seven years, and begetteth Lamech."
9329,ylt,"And Methuselah liveth after his begetting Lamech seven hundred and eighty and two years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
9330,ylt,"And all the days of Methuselah are nine hundred and sixty and nine years, and he dieth."
9331,ylt,"And Lamech liveth an hundred and eighty and two years, and begetteth a son,"
9332,ylt,"and calleth his name Noah, saying, `This `one' doth comfort us concerning our work, and concerning the labour of our hands, because of the ground which Jehovah hath cursed.'"
9333,ylt,"And Lamech liveth after his begetting Noah five hundred and ninety and five years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
9334,ylt,"And all the days of Lamech are seven hundred and seventy and seven years, and he dieth."
9335,ylt,"And Noah is a son of five hundred years, and Noah begetteth Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
9336,ylt,"And it cometh to pass that mankind have begun to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters have been born to them,"
9337,ylt,"and sons of God see the daughters of men that they `are' fair, and they take to themselves women of all whom they have chosen."
9338,ylt,"And Jehovah saith, `My Spirit doth not strive in man -- to the age; in their erring they `are' flesh:' and his days have been an hundred and twenty years."
9339,ylt,"The fallen ones were in the earth in those days, and even afterwards when sons of God come in unto daughters of men, and they have borne to them -- they `are' the heroes, who, from of old, `are' the men of name."
9340,ylt,"And Jehovah seeth that abundant `is' the wickedness of man in the earth, and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart only evil all the day;"
9341,ylt,"and Jehovah repenteth that He hath made man in the earth, and He grieveth Himself -- unto His heart."
9342,ylt,"And Jehovah saith, `I wipe away man whom I have prepared from off the face of the ground, from man unto beast, unto creeping thing, and unto fowl of the heavens, for I have repented that I have made them.'"
9343,ylt,And Noah found grace in the eyes of Jehovah.
9344,ylt,These `are' births of Noah: Noah `is' a righteous man; perfect he hath been among his generations; with God hath Noah walked habitually.
9345,ylt,"And Noah begetteth three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
9346,ylt,"And the earth is corrupt before God, and the earth is filled `with' violence."
9347,ylt,"And God seeth the earth, and lo, it hath been corrupted, for all flesh hath corrupted its way on the earth."
9348,ylt,"And God said to Noah, `An end of all flesh hath come before Me, for the earth hath been full of violence from their presence; and lo, I am destroying them with the earth."
9349,ylt,"`Make for thyself an ark of gopher-wood; rooms dost thou make with the ark, and thou hast covered it within and without with cypress;"
9350,ylt,"and this `is' that which thou dost with it: three hundred cubits `is' the length of the ark, fifty cubits its breadth, and thirty cubits its height;"
9351,ylt,"a window dost thou make for the ark, and unto a cubit thou dost restrain it from above; and the opening of the ark thou dost put in its side, -- lower, second, and third `stories' dost thou make it."
9352,ylt,"`And I, lo, I am bringing in the deluge of waters on the earth to destroy all flesh, in which `is' a living spirit, from under the heavens; all that `is' in the earth doth expire."
9353,ylt,"`And I have established My covenant with thee, and thou hast come in unto the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy son's wives with thee;"
9354,ylt,"and of all that liveth, of all flesh, two of every `sort' thou dost bring in unto the ark, to keep alive with thee; male and female are they."
9355,ylt,"Of the fowl after its kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every `sort' they come in unto thee, to keep alive."
9356,ylt,"`And thou, take to thyself of all food that is eaten; and thou hast gathered unto thyself, and it hath been to thee and to them for food.'"
9357,ylt,And Noah doth according to all that God hath commanded him; so hath he done.
9358,ylt,"And Jehovah saith to Noah, `Come in, thou and all thy house, unto the ark, for thee I have seen righteous before Me in this generation;"
9359,ylt,"of all the clean beasts thou dost take to thee seven pairs, a male and its female; and of the beasts which are not clean two, a male and its female;"
9360,ylt,"also, of fowl of the heavens seven pairs, a male and a female, to keep alive seed on the face of all the earth;"
9361,ylt,"for after other seven days I am sending rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and have wiped away all the substance that I have made from off the face of the ground.'"
9362,ylt,And Noah doth according to all that Jehovah hath commanded him:
9363,ylt,"and Noah `is' a son of six hundred years, and the deluge of waters hath been upon the earth."
9364,ylt,"And Noah goeth in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, unto the ark, from the presence of the waters of the deluge;"
9365,ylt,"of the clean beasts and of the beasts that `are' not clean, and of the fowl, and of every thing that is creeping upon the ground,"
9366,ylt,"two by two they have come in unto Noah, unto the ark, a male and a female, as God hath commanded Noah."
9367,ylt,"And it cometh to pass, after the seventh of the days, that waters of the deluge have been on the earth."
9368,ylt,"In the six hundredth year of the life of Noah, in the second month, in the seventeenth day of the month, in this day have been broken up all fountains of the great deep, and the net-work of the heavens hath been opened,"
9369,ylt,and the shower is on the earth forty days and forty nights.
9370,ylt,"In this self-same day went in Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, sons of Noah, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them, unto the ark;"
9371,ylt,"they, and every living creature after its kind, and every beast after its kind, and every creeping thing that is creeping on the earth after its kind, and every fowl after its kind, every bird -- every wing."
9372,ylt,"And they come in unto Noah, unto the ark, two by two of all the flesh in which `is' a living spirit;"
9373,ylt,"and they that are coming in, male and female of all flesh, have come in as God hath commanded him, and Jehovah doth close `it' for him."
9374,ylt,"And the deluge is forty days on the earth, and the waters multiply, and lift up the ark, and it is raised up from off the earth;"
9375,ylt,"and the waters are mighty, and multiply exceedingly upon the earth; and the ark goeth on the face of the waters."
9376,ylt,"And the waters have been very very mighty on the earth, and covered are all the high mountains which `are' under the whole heavens;"
9377,ylt,"fifteen cubits upwards have the waters become mighty, and the mountains are covered;"
9378,ylt,"and expire doth all flesh that is moving on the earth, among fowl, and among cattle, and among beasts, and among all the teeming things which are teeming on the earth, and all mankind;"
9379,ylt,all in whose nostrils `is' breath of a living spirit -- of all that `is' in the dry land -- have died.
9380,ylt,"And wiped away is all the substance that is on the face of the ground, from man unto beast, unto creeping thing, and unto fowl of the heavens; yea, they are wiped away from the earth, and only Noah is left, and those who `are' with him in the ark;"
9381,ylt,and the waters are mighty on the earth a hundred and fifty days.
9382,ylt,"And God remembereth Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle which `are' with him in the ark, and God causeth a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subside,"
9383,ylt,"and closed are the fountains of the deep and the net-work of the heavens, and restrained is the shower from the heavens."
9384,ylt,"And turn back do the waters from off the earth, going on and returning; and the waters are lacking at the end of a hundred and fifty days."
9385,ylt,"And the ark resteth, in the seventh month, in the seventeenth day of the month, on mountains of Ararat;"
9386,ylt,"and the waters have been going and becoming lacking till the tenth month; in the tenth `month', on the first of the month, appeared the heads of the mountains."
9387,ylt,"And it cometh to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah openeth the window of the ark which he made,"
9388,ylt,"and he sendeth forth the raven, and it goeth out, going out and turning back till the drying of the waters from off the earth."
9389,ylt,"And he sendeth forth the dove from him to see whether the waters have been lightened from off the face of the ground,"
9390,ylt,"and the dove hath not found rest for the sole of her foot, and she turneth back unto him, unto the ark, for waters `are' on the face of all the earth, and he putteth out his hand, and taketh her, and bringeth her in unto him, unto the ark."
9391,ylt,"And he stayeth yet other seven days, and addeth to send forth the dove from the ark;"
9392,ylt,"and the dove cometh in unto him at even-time, and lo, an olive leaf torn off in her mouth; and Noah knoweth that the waters have been lightened from off the earth."
9393,ylt,"And he stayeth yet other seven days, and sendeth forth the dove, and it added not to turn back unto him any more."
9394,ylt,"And it cometh to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first `month', in the first of the month, the waters have been dried from off the earth; and Noah turneth aside the covering of the ark, and looketh, and lo, the face of the ground hath been dried."
9395,ylt,"And in the second month, in the seven and twentieth day of the month, the earth hath become dry."
9396,ylt,"And God speaketh unto Noah, saying, `Go out from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee;"
9397,ylt,"every living thing that `is' with thee, of all flesh, among fowl, and among cattle, and among every creeping thing which is creeping on the earth, bring out with thee;"
9398,ylt,"and they have teemed in the earth, and been fruitful, and have multiplied on the earth.'"
9399,ylt,"And Noah goeth out, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him;"
9400,ylt,"every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl; every creeping thing on the earth, after their families, have gone out from the ark."
9401,ylt,"And Noah buildeth an altar to Jehovah, and taketh of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and causeth burnt-offerings to ascend on the altar;"
9402,ylt,"and Jehovah smelleth the sweet fragrance, and Jehovah saith unto His heart, `I continue not to disesteem any more the ground because of man, though the imagination of the heart of man `is' evil from his youth; and I continue not to smite any more all living, as I have done;"
9403,ylt,"during all days of the earth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, do not cease.'"
9404,ylt,"And God blesseth Noah, and his sons, and saith to them, `Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth;"
9405,ylt,"and your fear and your dread is on every beast of the earth, and on every fowl of the heavens, on all that creepeth on the ground, and on all fishes of the sea -- into your hand they have been given."
9406,ylt,"Every creeping thing that is alive, to you it is for food; as the green herb I have given to you the whole;"
9407,ylt,only flesh in its life -- its blood -- ye do not eat.
9408,ylt,"`And only your blood for your lives do I require; from the hand of every living thing I require it, and from the hand of man, from the hand of every man's brother I require the life of man;"
9409,ylt,"whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man is his blood shed: for in the image of God hath He made man."
9410,ylt,"And ye, be fruitful and multiply, teem in the earth, and multiply in it.'"
9411,ylt,"And God speaketh unto Noah, and unto his sons with him, saying,"
9412,ylt,"`And I, lo, I am establishing My covenant with you, and with your seed after you,"
9413,ylt,"and with every living creature which `is' with you, among fowl, among cattle, and among every beast of the earth with you, from all who are going out of the ark -- to every beast of the earth."
9414,ylt,"And I have established My covenant with you, and all flesh is not any more cut off by waters of a deluge, and there is not any more a deluge to destroy the earth.'"
9415,ylt,"And God saith, `This is a token of the covenant which I am giving between Me and you, and every living creature that `is' with you, to generations age-during;"
9416,ylt,"My bow I have given in the cloud, and it hath been for a token of a covenant between Me and the earth;"
9417,ylt,"and it hath come to pass (in My sending a cloud over the earth) that the bow hath been seen in the cloud,"
9418,ylt,"and I have remembered My covenant which is between Me and you, and every living creature among all flesh, and the waters become no more a deluge to destroy all flesh;"
9419,ylt,"and the bow hath been in the cloud, and I have seen it -- to remember the covenant age-during between God and every living creature among all flesh which `is' on the earth.'"
9420,ylt,"And God saith unto Noah, `This `is' a token of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that `is' upon the earth.'"
9421,ylt,"And the sons of Noah who are going out of the ark are Shem, and Ham, and Japheth; and Ham is father of Canaan."
9422,ylt,"These three `are' sons of Noah, and from these hath all the earth been overspread."
9423,ylt,"And Noah remaineth a man of the ground, and planteth a vineyard,"
9424,ylt,"and drinketh of the wine, and is drunken, and uncovereth himself in the midst of the tent."
9425,ylt,"And Ham, father of Canaan, seeth the nakedness of his father, and declareth to his two brethren without."
9426,ylt,"And Shem taketh -- Japheth also -- the garment, and they place on the shoulder of them both, and go backward, and cover the nakedness of their father; and their faces `are' backward, and their father's nakedness they have not seen."
9427,ylt,"And Noah awaketh from his wine, and knoweth that which his young son hath done to him,"
9428,ylt,"and saith: `Cursed `is' Canaan, Servant of servants he is to his brethren.'"
9429,ylt,"And he saith: `Blessed of Jehovah my God `is' Shem, And Canaan is servant to him."
9430,ylt,"God doth give beauty to Japheth, And he dwelleth in tents of Shem, And Canaan is servant to him.'"
9431,ylt,And Noah liveth after the deluge three hundred and fifty years;
9432,ylt,"and all the days of Noah are nine hundred and fifty years, and he dieth."
9433,ylt,"And these `are' births of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and born to them are sons after the deluge."
9434,ylt,"`Sons of Japheth `are' Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras."
9435,ylt,"And sons of Gomer `are' Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah."
9436,ylt,"And sons of Javan `are' Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim."
9437,ylt,"By these have the isles of the nations been parted in their lands, each by his tongue, by their families, in their nations."
9438,ylt,"And sons of Ham `are' Cush, and Mitzraim, and Phut, and Canaan."
9439,ylt,"And sons of Cush `are' Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah; and sons of Raamah `are' Sheba and Dedan."
9440,ylt,And Cush hath begotten Nimrod;
9441,ylt,"he hath begun to be a hero in the land; he hath been a hero in hunting before Jehovah; therefore it is said, `As Nimrod the hero `in' hunting before Jehovah.'"
9442,ylt,"And the first part of his kingdom is Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar;"
9443,ylt,"from that land he hath gone out to Asshur, and buildeth Nineveh, even the broad places of the city, and Calah,"
9444,ylt,"and Resen, between Nineveh and Calah; it `is' the great city."
9445,ylt,"And Mitzraim hath begotten the Ludim, and the Anamim, and the Lehabim, and the Naphtuhim,"
9446,ylt,"and the Pathrusim, and the Casluhim, (whence have come out Philistim,) and the Caphtorim."
9447,ylt,"And Canaan hath begotten Sidon his first-born, and Heth,"
9448,ylt,"and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,"
9449,ylt,"and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,"
9450,ylt,"and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and afterwards have the families of the Canaanite been scattered."
9451,ylt,"And the border of the Canaanite is from Sidon, `in' thy coming towards Gerar, unto Gaza; `in' thy coming towards Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, unto Lasha."
9452,ylt,"These `are' sons of Ham, by their families, by their tongues, in their lands, in their nations."
9453,ylt,"As to Shem, father of all sons of Eber, brother of Japheth the elder, he hath also begotten:"
9454,ylt,"Sons of Shem `are' Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram."
9455,ylt,"And sons of Aram `are' Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash."
9456,ylt,"And Arphaxad hath begotten Salah, and Salah hath begotten Eber."
9457,ylt,"And to Eber have two sons been born; the name of the one `is' Peleg (for in his days hath the earth been divided,) and his brother's name `is' Joktan."
9458,ylt,"And Joktan hath begotten Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,"
9459,ylt,"and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,"
9460,ylt,"and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,"
9461,ylt,"and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab; all these `are' sons of Joktan;"
9462,ylt,"and their dwelling is from Mesha, `in' thy coming towards Sephar, a mount of the east."
9463,ylt,"These `are' sons of Shem, by their families, by their tongues, in their lands, by their nations."
9464,ylt,"These `are' families of the sons of Noah, by their births, in their nations, and by these have the nations been parted in the earth after the deluge."
9465,ylt,"And the whole earth is of one pronunciation, and of the same words,"
9466,ylt,"and it cometh to pass, in their journeying from the east, that they find a valley in the land of Shinar, and dwell there;"
9467,ylt,"and they say each one to his neighbour, `Give help, let us make bricks, and burn `them' thoroughly:' and the brick is to them for stone, and the bitumen hath been to them for mortar."
9468,ylt,"And they say, `Give help, let us build for ourselves a city and tower, and its head in the heavens, and make for ourselves a name, lest we be scattered over the face of all the earth.'"
9469,ylt,And Jehovah cometh down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men have builded;
9470,ylt,"and Jehovah saith, `Lo, the people `is' one, and one pronunciation `is' to them all, and this it hath dreamed of doing; and now, nothing is restrained from them of that which they have purposed to do."
9471,ylt,"Give help, let us go down, and mingle there their pronunciation, so that a man doth not understand the pronunciation of his companion.'"
9472,ylt,"And Jehovah doth scatter them from thence over the face of all the earth, and they cease to build the city;"
9473,ylt,"therefore hath `one' called its name Babel, for there hath Jehovah mingled the pronunciation of all the earth, and from thence hath Jehovah scattered them over the face of all the earth."
9474,ylt,"These `are' births of Shem: Shem `is' a son of an hundred years, and begetteth Arphaxad two years after the deluge."
9475,ylt,"And Shem liveth after his begetting Arphaxad five hundred years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
9476,ylt,"And Arphaxad hath lived five and thirty years, and begetteth Salah."
9477,ylt,"And Arphaxad liveth after his begetting Salah four hundred and three years, and begetteth sons and daughters."

9489,ylt,"And Nahor liveth after his begetting Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
9490,ylt,"And Terah liveth seventy years, and begetteth Abram, Nahor, and Haran."
9491,ylt,"And these `are' births of Terah: Terah hath begotten Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran hath begotten Lot;"
9492,ylt,"and Haran dieth in the presence of Terah his father, in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees."
9493,ylt,"And Abram and Nahor take to themselves wives; the name of Abram's wife `is' Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife `is' Milcah, daughter of Haran, father of Milcah, and father of Iscah."
9494,ylt,And Sarai is barren -- she hath no child.
9495,ylt,"And Terah taketh Abram his son, and Lot, son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, wife of Abram his son, and they go out with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go towards the land of Canaan; and they come unto Charan, and dwell there."
9496,ylt,"And the days of Terah are two hundred and five years, and Terah dieth in Charan."
9497,ylt,"And Jehovah saith unto Abram, `Go for thyself, from thy land, and from thy kindred, and from the house of thy father, unto the land which I shew thee."
9498,ylt,"And I make thee become a great nation, and bless thee, and make thy name great; and be thou a blessing."
9499,ylt,"And I bless those blessing thee, and him who is disesteeming thee I curse, and blessed in thee have been all families of the ground.'"
9500,ylt,"And Abram goeth on, as Jehovah hath spoken unto him, and Lot goeth with him, and Abram `is' a son of five and seventy years in his going out from Charan."
9501,ylt,"And Abram taketh Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they have gained, and the persons that they have obtained in Charan; and they go out to go towards the land of Canaan; and they come in to the land of Canaan."
9502,ylt,"And Abram passeth over into the land, unto the place Shechem, unto the oak of Moreh; and the Canaanite `is' then in the land."
9503,ylt,"And Jehovah appeareth unto Abram, and saith, `To thy seed I give this land;' and he buildeth there an altar to Jehovah, who hath appeared unto him."
9504,ylt,"And he removeth from thence towards a mountain at the east of Beth-El, and stretcheth out the tent (Beth-El at the west, and Hai at the east), and he buildeth there an altar to Jehovah, and preacheth in the name of Jehovah."
9505,ylt,"And Abram journeyeth, going on and journeying towards the south."
9506,ylt,"And there is a famine in the land, and Abram goeth down towards Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine `is' grievous in the land;"
9507,ylt,"and it cometh to pass as he hath drawn near to enter Egypt, that he saith unto Sarai his wife, `Lo, I pray thee, I have known that thou `art' a woman of beautiful appearance;"
9508,ylt,"and it hath come to pass that the Egyptians see thee, and they have said, `This `is' his wife,' and they have slain me, and thee they keep alive:"
9509,ylt,"say, I pray thee, thou `art' my sister, so that it is well with me because of thee, and my soul hath lived for thy sake.'"
9510,ylt,"And it cometh to pass, at the entering of Abram into Egypt, that the Egyptians see the woman that she `is' exceeding fair;"
9511,ylt,"and princes of Pharaoh see her, and praise her unto Pharaoh, and the woman is taken `to' Pharaoh's house;"
9512,ylt,"and to Abram he hath done good because of her, and he hath sheep and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and handmaids, and she-asses, and camels."
9513,ylt,"And Jehovah plagueth Pharaoh and his house -- great plagues -- for the matter of Sarai, Abram's wife."
9514,ylt,"And Pharaoh calleth for Abram, and saith, `What `is' this thou hast done to me? why hast thou not declared to me that she `is' thy wife?"
9515,ylt,"Why hast thou said, She `is' my sister, and I take her to myself for a wife? and now, lo, thy wife, take and go.'"
9516,ylt,"And Pharaoh chargeth men concerning him, and they send him away, and his wife, an all that he hath."
9517,ylt,"And Abram goeth up from Egypt (he and his wife, and all that he hath, and Lot with him) towards the south;"
9518,ylt,"and Abram `is' exceedingly wealthy in cattle, in silver, and in gold."
9519,ylt,"And he goeth on his journeyings from the south, even unto Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the commencement, between Bethel and Hai --"
9520,ylt,"unto the place of the altar which he made there at the first, and there doth Abram preach in the name of Jehovah."
9521,ylt,"And also to Lot, who is going with Abram, there hath been sheep and oxen and tents;"
9522,ylt,"and the land hath not suffered them to dwell together, for their substance hath been much, and they have not been able to dwell together;"
9523,ylt,and there is a strife between those feeding Abram's cattle and those feeding Lot's cattle; and the Canaanite and the Perizzite `are' then dwelling in the land.
9524,ylt,"And Abram saith unto Lot, `Let there not, I pray thee, be strife between me and thee, and between my shepherds and thy shepherds, for we `are' men -- brethren."
9525,ylt,"Is not all the land before thee? be parted, I pray thee, from me; if to the left, then I to the right; and if to the right, then I to the left.'"
9526,ylt,"And Lot lifteth up his eyes, and seeth the whole circuit of the Jordan that it `is' all a watered country (before Jehovah's destroying Sodom and Gomorrah, as Jehovah's garden, as the land of Egypt,) in thy coming toward Zoar,"
9527,ylt,"and Lot chooseth for himself the whole circuit of the Jordan; and Lot journeyeth from the east, and they are parted -- a man from his companion;"
9528,ylt,"Abram hath dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot hath dwelt in the cities of the circuit, and tenteth unto Sodom;"
9529,ylt,"and the men of Sodom `are' evil, and sinners before Jehovah exceedingly."
9530,ylt,"And Jehovah said unto Abram, after Lot's being parted from him, `Lift up, I pray thee, thine eyes, and look from the place where thou `art', northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward;"
9531,ylt,"for the whole of the land which thou are seeing, to thee I give it, and to thy seed -- to the age."
9532,ylt,"And I have set thy seed as dust of the earth, so that, if one is able to number the dust of the earth, even thy seed is numbered;"
9533,ylt,"rise, go up and down through the land, to its length, and to its breadth, for to thee I give it.'"
9534,ylt,"And Abram tenteth, and cometh, and dwelleth among the oaks of Mamre, which `are' in Hebron, and buildeth there an altar to Jehovah."
9535,ylt,"And it cometh to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goyim,"
9536,ylt,"they have made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboim, and the king of Bela, which `is' Zoar."
9537,ylt,"All these have been joined together unto the valley of Siddim, which `is' the Salt Sea;"
9538,ylt,"twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and the thirteenth year they rebelled."
9539,ylt,"And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings who `are' with him, and they smite the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim,"
9540,ylt,"and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-Paran, which `is' by the wilderness;"
9541,ylt,"and they turn back and come in unto En-Mishpat, which `is' Kadesh, and smite the whole field of the Amalekite, and also the Amorite who is dwelling in Hazezon-Tamar."
9542,ylt,"And the king of Sodom goeth out, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboim, and the king of Bela, which `is' Zoar; and they set the battle in array with them in the valley of Siddim,"
9543,ylt,"with Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goyim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with the five."
9544,ylt,"And the valley of Siddim `is' full of bitumen-pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah flee, and fall there, and those left have fled to the mountain."
9545,ylt,"And they take the whole substance of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the whole of their food, and go away;"
9546,ylt,"and they take Lot, Abram's brother's son (seeing he is dwelling in Sodom), and his substance, and go away."
9547,ylt,"And one who is escaping cometh and declareth to Abram the Hebrew, and he is dwelling among the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner, and they `are' Abram's allies."
9548,ylt,"And Abram heareth that his brother hath been taken captive, and he draweth out his trained domestics, three hundred and eighteen, and pursueth unto Dan."
9549,ylt,"And he divideth himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smiteth them, and pursueth them unto Hobah, which `is' at the left of Damascus;"
9550,ylt,"and he bringeth back the whole of the substance, and also Lot his brother and his substance hath he brought back, and also the women and the people."
9551,ylt,"And the king of Sodom goeth out to meet him (after his turning back from the smiting of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings who `are' with him), unto the valley of Shaveh, which `is' the king's valley."
9552,ylt,"And Melchizedek king of Salem hath brought out bread and wine, and he `is' priest of God Most High;"
9553,ylt,"and he blesseth him, and saith, `Blessed `is' Abram to God Most High, possessing heaven and earth;"
9554,ylt,"and blessed `is' God Most High, who hath delivered thine adversaries into thy hand;' and he giveth to him a tenth of all."
9555,ylt,"And the king of Sodom saith unto Abram, `Give to me the persons, and the substance take to thyself,'"
9556,ylt,"and Abram saith unto the king of Sodom, `I have lifted up my hand unto Jehovah, God Most High, possessing heaven and earth --"
9557,ylt,"from a thread even unto a shoe-latchet I take not of anything which thou hast, that thou say not, I -- I have made Abram rich;"
9558,ylt,"save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who have gone with me -- Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre -- they take their portion.'"
9559,ylt,"After these things hath the word of Jehovah been unto Abram in a vision, saying, `Fear not, Abram, I `am' a shield to thee, thy reward `is' exceeding great.'"
9560,ylt,"And Abram saith, `Lord Jehovah, what dost Thou give to me, and I am going childless? and an acquired son in my house is Demmesek Eliezer.'"
9561,ylt,"And Abram saith, `Lo, to me Thou hast not given seed, and lo, a domestic doth heir me.'"
9562,ylt,"And lo, the word of Jehovah `is' unto him, saying, `This `one' doth not heir thee; but he who cometh out from thy bowels, he doth heir thee;'"
9563,ylt,"and He bringeth him out without, and saith, `Look attentively, I pray thee, towards the heavens, and count the stars, if thou art able to count them;' and He saith to him, `Thus is thy seed.'"
9564,ylt,"And he hath believed in Jehovah, and He reckoneth it to him -- righteousness."
9565,ylt,"And He saith unto him, `I `am' Jehovah who brought thee out from Ur of the Chaldees, to give to thee this land to possess it;'"
9566,ylt,"and he saith, `Lord Jehovah, whereby do I know that I possess it?'"
9567,ylt,"And He saith unto him, `Take for Me a heifer of three years, and a she-goat of three years, and a ram of three years, and a turtle-dove, and a young bird;'"
9568,ylt,"and he taketh to him all these, and separateth them in the midst, and putteth each piece over against its fellow, but the bird he hath not divided;"
9569,ylt,"and the ravenous birds come down upon the carcases, and Abram causeth them to turn back."
9570,ylt,"And the sun is about to go in, and deep sleep hath fallen upon Abram, and lo, a terror of great darkness is falling upon him;"
9571,ylt,"and He saith to Abram, `knowing -- know that thy seed is a sojourner in a land not theirs, and they have served them, and they have afflicted them four hundred years,"
9572,ylt,"and the nation also whom they serve I judge, and after this they go out with great substance;"
9573,ylt,and thou -- thou comest in unto thy fathers in peace; thou art buried in a good old age;
9574,ylt,"and the fourth generation doth turn back hither, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete.'"
9575,ylt,"And it cometh to pass -- the sun hath gone in, and thick darkness hath been -- and lo, a furnace of smoke, and a lamp of fire, which hath passed over between those pieces."
9576,ylt,"In that day hath Jehovah made with Abram a covenant, saying, `To thy seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Phrat,"
9577,ylt,"with the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,"
9578,ylt,"and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,"
9579,ylt,"and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.'"
9580,ylt,"And Sarai, Abram's wife, hath not borne to him, and she hath an handmaid, an Egyptian, and her name `is' Hagar;"
9581,ylt,"and Sarai saith unto Abram, `Lo, I pray thee, Jehovah hath restrained me from bearing, go in, I pray thee, unto my handmaid; perhaps I am built up from her;' and Abram hearkeneth to the voice of Sarai."
9582,ylt,"And Sarai, Abram's wife, taketh Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, at the end of the tenth year of Abram's dwelling in the land of Canaan, and giveth her to Abram her husband, to him for a wife,"
9583,ylt,"and he goeth in unto Hagar, and she conceiveth, and she seeth that she hath conceived, and her mistress is lightly esteemed in her eyes."
9584,ylt,"And Sarai saith unto Abram, `My violence `is' for thee; I -- I have given mine handmaid into thy bosom, and she seeth that she hath conceived, and I am lightly esteemed in her eyes; Jehovah doth judge between me and thee.'"
9585,ylt,"And Abram saith unto Sarai, `Lo, thine handmaid `is' in thine hand, do to her that which is good in thine eyes;' and Sarai afflicted her, and she fleeth from her presence."
9586,ylt,"And a messenger of Jehovah findeth her by the fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way `to' Shur,"
9587,ylt,"and he saith, `Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, whence hast thou come, and whither dost thou go?' and she saith, `From the presence of Sarai, my mistress, I am fleeing.'"
9588,ylt,"And the messenger of Jehovah saith to her, `Turn back unto thy mistress, and humble thyself under her hands;'"
9589,ylt,"and the messenger of Jehovah saith to her, `Multiplying I multiply thy seed, and it is not numbered from multitude;'"
9590,ylt,"and the messenger of Jehovah saith to her, `Behold thou `art' conceiving, and bearing a son, and hast called his name Ishmael, for Jehovah hath hearkened unto thine affliction;"
9591,ylt,"and he is a wild-ass man, his hand against every one, and every one's hand against him -- and before the face of all his brethren he dwelleth.'"
9592,ylt,"And she calleth the name of Jehovah who is speaking unto her, `Thou `art', O God, my beholder;' for she said, `Even here have I looked behind my beholder?'"
9593,ylt,"therefore hath one called the well, `The well of the Living One, my beholder;' lo, between Kadesh and Bered."
9594,ylt,"And Hagar beareth to Abram a son; and Abram calleth the name of his son, whom Hagar hath borne, Ishmael;"
9595,ylt,and Abram `is' a son of eighty and six years in Hagar's bearing Ishmael to Abram.
9596,ylt,"And Abram is a son of ninety and nine years, and Jehovah appeareth unto Abram, and saith unto him, `I `am' God Almighty, walk habitually before Me, and be thou perfect;"
9597,ylt,"and I give My covenant between Me and thee, and multiply thee very exceedingly.'"
9598,ylt,"And Abram falleth upon his face, and God speaketh with him, saying,"
9599,ylt,"`I -- lo, My covenant `is' with thee, and thou hast become father of a multitude of nations;"
9600,ylt,"and thy name is no more called Abram, but thy name hath been Abraham, for father of a multitude of nations have I made thee;"
9601,ylt,"and I have made thee exceeding fruitful, and made thee become nations, and kings go out from thee."
9602,ylt,"`And I have established My covenant between Me and thee, and thy seed after thee, to their generations, for a covenant age-during, to become God to thee, and to thy seed after thee;"
9603,ylt,"and I have given to thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojournings, the whole land of Canaan, for a possession age-during, and I have become their God.'"
9604,ylt,"And God saith unto Abraham, `And thou dost keep My covenant, thou and thy seed after thee, to their generations;"
9605,ylt,"this `is' My covenant which ye keep between Me and you, and thy seed after thee: Every male of you `is' to be circumcised;"
9606,ylt,"and ye have circumcised the flesh of your foreskin, and it hath become a token of a covenant between Me and you."
9607,ylt,"`And a son of eight days is circumcised by you; every male to your generations, born in the house, or bought with money from any son of a stranger, who is not of thy seed;"
9608,ylt,"he is certainly circumcised who `is' born in thine house, or bought with thy money; and My covenant hath become in your flesh a covenant age-during;"
9609,ylt,"and an uncircumcised one, a male, the flesh of whose foreskin is not circumcised, even that person hath been cut off from his people; My covenant he hath broken.'"
9610,ylt,"And God saith unto Abraham, `Sarai thy wife -- thou dost not call her name Sarai, for Sarah `is' her name;"
9611,ylt,"and I have blessed her, and have also given to thee a son from her; and I have blessed her, and she hath become nations -- kings of peoples are from her.'"
9612,ylt,"And Abraham falleth upon his face, and laugheth, and saith in his heart, `To the son of an hundred years is one born? or doth Sarah -- daughter of ninety years -- bear?'"
9613,ylt,"And Abraham saith unto God, `O that Ishmael may live before Thee;'"
9614,ylt,"and God saith, `Sarah thy wife is certainly bearing a son to thee, and thou hast called his name Isaac, and I have established My covenant with him, for a covenant age-during, to his seed after him."
9615,ylt,"As to Ishmael, I have heard thee; lo, I have blessed him, and made him fruitful, and multiplied him, very exceedingly; twelve princes doth he beget, and I have made him become a great nation;"
9616,ylt,"and My covenant I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah doth bear to thee at this appointed time in the next year;'"
9617,ylt,"and He finisheth speaking with him, and God goeth up from Abraham."
9618,ylt,"And Abraham taketh Ishmael his son, and all those born in his house, and all those bought with his money -- every male among the men of Abraham's house -- and circumciseth the flesh of their foreskin, in this self-same day, as God hath spoken with him."
9619,ylt,And Abraham `is' a son of ninety and nine years in the flesh of his foreskin being circumcised;
9620,ylt,and Ishmael his son `is' a son of thirteen years in the flesh of his foreskin being circumcised;
9621,ylt,"in this self-same day hath Abraham been circumcised, and Ishmael his son;"
9622,ylt,"and all the men of his house -- born in the house, and bought with money from the son of a stranger -- have been circumcised with him."
9623,ylt,"And Jehovah appeareth unto him among the oaks of Mamre, and he is sitting at the opening of the tent, about the heat of the day;"
9624,ylt,"and he lifteth up his eyes and looketh, and lo, three men standing by him, and he seeth, and runneth to meet them from the opening of the tent, and boweth himself towards the earth,"
9625,ylt,"And he saith, `My Lord, if, I pray thee, I have found grace in thine eyes, do not, I pray thee, pass on from thy servant;"
9626,ylt,"let, I pray thee, a little water be accepted, and wash your feet, and recline under the tree;"
9627,ylt,"and I bring a piece of bread, and support ye your heart; afterwards pass on, for therefore have ye passed over unto your servant;' and they say, `So mayest thou do as thou has spoken.'"
9628,ylt,"And Abraham hasteth towards the tent, unto Sarah, and saith, `Hasten three measures of flour-meal, knead, and make cakes;'"
9629,ylt,"and Abraham ran unto the herd, and taketh a son of the herd, tender and good, and giveth unto the young man, and he hasteth to prepare it;"
9630,ylt,"and he taketh butter and milk, and the son of the herd which he hath prepared, and setteth before them; and he is standing by them under the tree, and they do eat."
9631,ylt,"And they say unto him, `Where `is' Sarah thy wife?' and he saith, `Lo -- in the tent;'"
9632,ylt,"and he saith, `returning I return unto thee, about the time of life, and lo, to Sarah thy wife a son.'"
9633,ylt,"And Sarah is hearkening at the opening of the tent, which is behind him;"
9634,ylt,"and Abraham and Sarah `are' aged, entering into days -- the way of women hath ceased to be to Sarah;"
9635,ylt,"and Sarah laugheth in her heart, saying, `After I have waxed old I have had pleasure! -- my lord also `is' old!'"
9636,ylt,"And Jehovah saith unto Abraham, `Why `is' this? Sarah hath laughed, saying, Is it true really -- I bear -- and I am aged? Is any thing too wonderful for Jehovah? at the appointed time I return unto thee, about the time of life, and Sarah hath a son.'"
9637,ylt,"And Sarah denieth, saying, `I did not laugh;' for she hath been afraid; and He saith, `Nay, but thou didst laugh.'"
9638,ylt,"And the men rise from thence, and look on the face of Sodom, and Abraham is going with them to send them away;"
9639,ylt,"and Jehovah said, `Am I concealing from Abraham that which I am doing,"
9640,ylt,"and Abraham certainly becometh a nation great and mighty, and blessed in him have been all nations of the earth?"
9641,ylt,"for I have known him, that he commandeth his children, and his house after him (and they have kept the way of Jehovah), to do righteousness and judgment, that Jehovah may bring on Abraham that which He hath spoken concerning him.'"
9642,ylt,"And Jehovah saith, `The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah -- because great; and their sin -- because exceeding grievous:"
9643,ylt,"I go down now, and see whether according to its cry which is coming unto Me they have done completely -- and if not -- I know;'"
9644,ylt,"and the men turn from thence, and go towards Sodom; and Abraham is yet standing before Jehovah."
9645,ylt,"And Abraham draweth nigh and saith, `Dost Thou also consume righteous with wicked?"
9646,ylt,"peradventure there are fifty righteous in the midst of the city; dost Thou also consume, and not bear with the place for the sake of the fifty -- the righteous who `are' in its midst?"
9647,ylt,"Far be it from Thee to do according to this thing, to put to death the righteous with the wicked; that it hath been -- as the righteous so the wicked -- far be it from Thee; doth the Judge of all the earth not do justice?'"
9648,ylt,"And Jehovah saith, `If I find in Sodom fifty righteous in the midst of the city, then have I borne with all the place for their sake.'"
9649,ylt,"And Abraham answereth and saith, `Lo, I pray thee, I have willed to speak unto the Lord, and I -- dust and ashes;"
9650,ylt,"peradventure there are lacking five of the fifty righteous -- dost Thou destroy for five the whole of the city?' and He saith, `I destroy `it' not, if I find there forty and five.'"
9651,ylt,"And he addeth again to speak unto Him and saith, `Peradventure there are found there forty?' and He saith, `I do `it' not, because of the forty.'"
9652,ylt,"And he saith, `Let it not be, I Pray thee, displeasing to the Lord, and I speak: peradventure there are found there thirty?' and He saith, `I do `it' not, if I find there thirty.'"
9653,ylt,"And he saith, `Lo, I pray thee, I have willed to speak unto the Lord: peradventure there are found there twenty?' and He saith, `I do not destroy `it', because of the twenty.'"
9654,ylt,"And he saith, `Let it not be, I pray Thee, displeasing to the Lord, and I speak only this time: peradventure there are found there ten?' and He saith, `I do not destroy `it', because of the ten.'"
9655,ylt,"And Jehovah goeth on, when He hath finished speaking unto Abraham, and Abraham hath turned back to his place."
9656,ylt,"And two of the messengers come towards Sodom at even, and Lot is sitting at the gate of Sodom, and Lot seeth, and riseth to meet them, and boweth himself -- face to the earth,"
9657,ylt,"and he saith, `Lo, I pray you, my lords, turn aside, I pray you, unto the house of your servant, and lodge, and wash your feet -- then ye have risen early and gone on your way;' and they say, `Nay, but in the broad place we do lodge.'"
9658,ylt,"And he presseth on them greatly, and they turn aside unto him, and come in unto his house; and he maketh for them a banquet, and hath baked unleavened things; and they do eat."
9659,ylt,"Before they lie down, the men of the city -- men of Sodom -- have come round about against the house, from young even unto aged, all the people from the extremity;"
9660,ylt,"and they call unto Lot and say to him, `Where `are' the men who have come in unto thee to-night? bring them out unto us, and we know them.'"
9661,ylt,"And Lot goeth out unto them, to the opening, and the door hath shut behind him,"
9662,ylt,"and saith, `Do not, I pray you, my brethren, do evil;"
9663,ylt,"lo, I pray you, I have two daughters, who have not known any one; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do to them as `is' good in your eyes; only to these men do not anything, for therefore have they come in within the shadow of my roof.'"
9664,ylt,"And they say, `Come nigh hither;' they say also, `This one hath come in to sojourn, and he certainly judgeth! now, we do evil to thee more than `to' them;' and they press against the man, against Lot greatly, and come nigh to break the door."
9665,ylt,"And the men put forth their hand, and bring in Lot unto them, into the house, and have shut the door;"
9666,ylt,"and the men who `are' at the opening of the house they have smitten with blindness, from small even unto great, and they weary themselves to find the opening."
9667,ylt,"And the men say unto Lot, `Whom hast thou here still? son-in-law, thy sons also, and thy daughters, and all whom thou hast in the city, bring out from this place;"
9668,ylt,"for we are destroying this place, for their cry hath been great `before' the face of Jehovah, and Jehovah doth send us to destroy it.'"
9669,ylt,"And Lot goeth out, and speaketh unto his sons-in-law, those taking his daughters, and saith, `Rise, go out from this place, for Jehovah is destroying the city;' and he is as `one' mocking in the eyes of his sons-in-law."
9670,ylt,"And when the dawn hath ascended, then the messengers press upon Lot, saying, `Rise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters who are found present, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.'"
9671,ylt,"And he lingereth, and the men lay hold on his hand, and on the hand of his wife, and on the hand of his two daughters, through the mercy of Jehovah unto him, and they bring him out, and cause him to rest without the city."
9672,ylt,"And it cometh to pass when he hath brought them out without, that he saith, `Escape for thy life; look not expectingly behind thee, nor stand thou in all the circuit; to the mountain escape, lest thou be consumed.'"
9673,ylt,"And Lot saith unto them, `Not `so', I pray thee, my lord;"
9674,ylt,"lo, I pray thee, thy servant hath found grace in thine eyes, and thou dost make great thy kindness which thou hast done with me by saving my life, and I am unable to escape to the mountain, lest the evil cleave `to' me, and I have died;"
9675,ylt,"lo, I pray thee, this city `is' near to flee thither, and it `is' little; let me escape, I pray thee, thither, (is it not little?) and my soul doth live.'"
9676,ylt,"And he saith unto him, `Lo, I have accepted thy face also for this thing, without overthrowing the city `for' which thou hast spoken;"
9677,ylt,"haste, escape thither, for I am not able to do anything till thine entering thither;' therefore hath he calleth the name of the city Zoar."
9678,ylt,"The sun hath gone out on the earth, and Lot hath entered into Zoar,"
9679,ylt,"and Jehovah hath rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah, from the heavens;"
9680,ylt,"and He overthroweth these cities, and all the circuit, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which is shooting up from the ground."
9681,ylt,"And his wife looketh expectingly from behind him, and she is -- a pillar of salt!"
9682,ylt,"And Abraham riseth early in the morning, unto the place where he hath stood `before' the face of Jehovah;"
9683,ylt,"and he looketh on the face of Sodom and Gomorrah, and on all the face of the land of the circuit, and seeth, and lo, the smoke of the land went up as smoke of the furnace."
9684,ylt,"And it cometh to pass, in God's destroying the cities of the circuit, that God remembereth Abraham, and sendeth Lot out of the midst of the overthrow in the overthrowing of the cities in which Lot dwelt."
9685,ylt,"And Lot goeth up out of Zoar, and dwelleth in the mountain, and his two daughters with him, for he hath been afraid of dwelling in Zoar, and he dwelleth in a cave, he and his two daughters."
9686,ylt,"And the first-born saith unto the younger, `Our father `is' old, and a man there is not in the earth to come in unto us, as `is' the way of all the earth;"
9687,ylt,"come, we cause our father to drink wine, and lie with him, and preserve from our father -- a seed.'"
9688,ylt,"And they cause their father to drink wine on that night; and the first-born goeth in, and lieth with her father, and he hath not known in her lying down, or in her rising up."
9689,ylt,"And it cometh to pass, on the morrow, that the first-born saith unto the younger, `Lo, I have lain yesterday-night with my father: we cause him to drink wine also to-night, and go thou in, lie with him, and we preserve from our father -- a seed.'"
9690,ylt,"And they cause their father to drink wine on that night also, and the younger riseth and lieth with him, and he hath not known in her lying down, or in her rising up."
9691,ylt,"And the two daughters of Lot conceive from their father,"
9692,ylt,"and the first-born beareth a son, and calleth his name Moab; he `is' father of Moab unto this day;"
9693,ylt,"as to the younger, she also hath born a son, and calleth his name Ben-Ammi: he `is' father of the Beni-Ammon unto this day."
9694,ylt,"And Abraham journeyeth from thence toward the land of the south, and dwelleth between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourneth in Gerar;"
9695,ylt,"and Abraham saith concerning Sarah his wife, `She is my sister;' and Abimelech king of Gerar sendeth and taketh Sarah."
9696,ylt,"And God cometh in unto Abimelech in a dream of the night, and saith to him, `Lo, thou `art' a dead man, because of the woman whom thou hast taken -- and she married to a husband.'"
9697,ylt,"And Abimelech hath not drawn near unto her, and he saith, `Lord, also a righteous nation dost thou slay?"
9698,ylt,"hath not he himself said to me, She `is' my sister! and she, even she herself, said, He `is' my brother; in the integrity of my heart, and in the innocency of my hands, I have done this.'"
9699,ylt,"And God saith unto him in the dream, `Yea, I -- I have known that in the integrity of thy heart thou hast done this, and I withhold thee, even I, from sinning against Me, therefore I have not suffered thee to come against her;"
9700,ylt,"and now send back the man's wife, for he `is' inspired, and he doth pray for thee, and live thou; and if thou do not send back, know that dying thou dost die, thou, and all that thou hast.'"
9701,ylt,"And Abimelech riseth early in the morning, and calleth for all his servants, and speaketh all these words in their ears; and the men fear exceedingly;"
9702,ylt,"and Abimelech calleth for Abraham, and saith to him, `What hast thou done to us? and what have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought upon me, and upon my kingdom, a great sin? works which are not done thou hast done with me.'"
9703,ylt,"Abimelech also saith unto Abraham, `What hast thou seen that thou hast done this thing?'"
9704,ylt,"And Abraham saith, `Because I said, `Surely the fear of God is not in this place, and they have slain me for the sake of my wife;"
9705,ylt,"and also, truly she is my sister, daughter of my father, only not daughter of my mother, and she becometh my wife;"
9706,ylt,"and it cometh to pass, when God hath caused me to wander from my father's house, that I say to her, This `is' thy kindness which thou dost with me: at every place whither we come, say of me, He `is' my brother.'"
9707,ylt,"And Abimelech taketh sheep and oxen, and servants and handmaids, and giveth to Abraham, and sendeth back to him Sarah his wife;"
9708,ylt,"and Abimelech saith, `Lo, my land `is' before thee, where it is good in thine eyes, dwell;'"
9709,ylt,"and to Sarah he hath said, `Lo, I have given a thousand silverlings to thy brother; lo, it is to thee a covering of eyes, to all who are with thee;' and by all this she is reasoned with."
9710,ylt,"And Abraham prayeth unto God, and God healeth Abimelech and his wife, and his handmaids, and they bear:"
9711,ylt,"for Jehovah restraining had restrained every womb of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife."
9712,ylt,"And Jehovah hath looked after Sarah as He hath said, and Jehovah doth to Sarah as He hath spoken;"
9713,ylt,"and Sarah conceiveth, and beareth a son to Abraham, to his old age, at the appointed time that God hath spoken of with him;"
9714,ylt,"and Abraham calleth the name of his son who is born to him, whom Sarah hath born to him -- Isaac;"
9715,ylt,"and Abraham circumciseth Isaac his son, `being' a son of eight days, as God hath commanded him."
9716,ylt,"And Abraham `is' a son of a hundred years in Isaac his son being born to him,"
9717,ylt,"and Sarah saith, `God hath made laughter for me; every one who is hearing laugheth for me.'"
9718,ylt,"She saith also, `Who hath said to Abraham, Sarah hath suckled sons, that I have born a son for his old age?'"
9719,ylt,"And the lad groweth, and is weaned, and Abraham maketh a great banquet in the day of Isaac's being weaned;"
9720,ylt,"and Sarah seeth the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she hath borne to Abraham, mocking,"
9721,ylt,"and she saith to Abraham, `Cast out this handmaid and her son; for the son of this handmaid hath no possession with my son -- with Isaac.'"
9722,ylt,"And the thing is very wrong in the eyes of Abraham, for his son's sake;"
9723,ylt,"and God saith unto Abraham, `Let it not be wrong in thine eyes because of the youth, and because of thy handmaid: all that Sarah saith unto thee -- hearken to her voice, for in Isaac is a seed called to thee."
9724,ylt,"As to the son of the handmaid also, for a nation I set him, because he `is' thy seed.'"
9725,ylt,"And Abraham riseth early in the morning, and taketh bread, and a bottle of water, and giveth unto Hagar (placing `it' on her shoulder), also the lad, and sendeth her out; and she goeth on, and goeth astray in the wilderness of Beer-Sheba;"
9726,ylt,"and the water is consumed from the bottle, and she placeth the lad under one of the shrubs."
9727,ylt,"And she goeth and sitteth by herself over-against, afar off, about a bow-shot, for she said, `Let me not look on the death of the lad;' and she sitteth over-against, and lifteth up her voice, and weepeth."
9728,ylt,"And God heareth the voice of the youth; and the messenger of God calleth unto Hagar from the heavens, and saith to her, `What to thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath hearkened unto the voice of the youth where he `is';"
9729,ylt,"rise, lift up the youth, and lay hold on him with thy hand, for for a great nation I set him.'"
9730,ylt,"And God openeth her eyes, and she seeth a well of water, and she goeth and filleth the bottle `with' water, and causeth the youth to drink;"
9731,ylt,"and God is with the youth, and he groweth, and dwelleth in the wilderness, and is an archer;"
9732,ylt,"and he dwelleth in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother taketh for him a wife from the land of Egypt."
9733,ylt,"And it cometh to pass at that time that Abimelech speaketh -- Phichol also, head of his host -- unto Abraham, saying, `God `is' with thee in all that thou art doing;"
9734,ylt,"and now, swear to me by God here: thou dost not lie to me, or to my continuator, or to my successor; according to the kindness which I have done with thee thou dost with me, and with the land in which thou hast sojourned.'"
9735,ylt,"And Abraham saith, `I -- I do swear.'"
9736,ylt,"And Abraham reasoned with Abimelech concerning the matter of a well of water which Abimelech's servants have taken violently away,"
9737,ylt,"and Abimelech saith, `I have not known who hath done this thing, and even thou didst not declare to me, and I also, I have not heard save to-day.'"
9738,ylt,"And Abraham taketh sheep and oxen, and giveth to Abimelech, and they make, both of them, a covenant;"
9739,ylt,and Abraham setteth seven Lambs of the flock by themselves.
9740,ylt,"And Abimelech saith unto Abraham, `What `are' they -- these seven lambs which thou hast set by themselves?'"
9741,ylt,"And he saith, `For -- the seven lambs thou dost accept from my hand, so that it becometh a witness for me that I have digged this well;'"
9742,ylt,"therefore hath he called that place `Beer-Sheba,' for there have both of them sworn."
9743,ylt,"And they make a covenant in Beer-Sheba, and Abimelech riseth -- Phichol also, head of his host -- and they turn back unto the land of the Philistines;"
9744,ylt,"and `Abraham' planteth a tamarask in Beer-Sheba, and preacheth there in the name of Jehovah, God age-during;"
9745,ylt,and Abraham sojourneth in the land of the Philistines many days.
9746,ylt,"And it cometh to pass after these things that God hath tried Abraham, and saith unto him, `Abraham;' and he saith, `Here `am' I.'"
9747,ylt,"And He saith, `Take, I pray thee, thy son, thine only one, whom thou hast loved, even Isaac, and go for thyself unto the land of Moriah, and cause him to ascend there for a burnt-offering on one of the mountains of which I speak unto thee.'"
9748,ylt,"And Abraham riseth early in the morning, and saddleth his ass, and taketh two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and he cleaveth the wood of the burnt-offering, and riseth and goeth unto the place of which God hath spoken to him."
9749,ylt,"On the third day -- Abraham lifteth up his eyes, and seeth the place from afar;"
9750,ylt,"and Abraham saith unto his young men, `Remain by yourselves here with the ass, and I and the youth go yonder and worship, and turn back unto you.'"
9751,ylt,"And Abraham taketh the wood of the burnt-offering, and placeth on Isaac his son, and he taketh in his hand the fire, and the knife; and they go on both of them together."
9752,ylt,"And Isaac speaketh unto Abraham his father, and saith, `My father,' and he saith, `Here `am' I, my son.' And he saith, `Lo, the fire and the wood, and where the lamb for a burnt-offering?'"
9753,ylt,"and Abraham saith, `God doth provide for Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son;' and they go on both of them together."
9754,ylt,"And they come in unto the place of which God hath spoken to him, and there Abraham buildeth the altar, and arrangeth the wood, and bindeth Isaac his son, and placeth him upon the altar above the wood;"
9755,ylt,"and Abraham putteth forth his hand, and taketh the knife -- to slaughter his son."
9756,ylt,"And the messenger of Jehovah calleth unto him from the heavens, and saith, `Abraham, Abraham;' and he saith, `Here `am' I;'"
9757,ylt,"and He saith, `Put not forth thine hand unto the youth, nor do anything to him, for now I have known that thou art fearing God, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only one, from Me.'"
9758,ylt,"And Abraham lifteth up his eyes, and looketh, and lo, a ram behind, seized in a thicket by its horns; and Abraham goeth, and taketh the ram, and causeth it to ascend for a burnt-offering instead of his son;"
9759,ylt,"and Abraham calleth the name of that place `Jehovah-Jireh,' because it is said this day in the mount, `Jehovah doth provide.'"
9760,ylt,"And the messenger of Jehovah calleth unto Abraham a second time from the heavens,"
9761,ylt,"and saith, `By Myself I have sworn -- the affirmation of Jehovah -- that because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only one --"
9762,ylt,"that blessing I bless thee, and multiplying I multiply thy seed as stars of the heavens, and as sand which `is' on the sea-shore; and thy seed doth possess the gate of his enemies;"
9763,ylt,"and blessed themselves in thy seed have all nations of the earth, because that thou hast hearkened to My voice.'"
9764,ylt,"And Abraham turneth back unto his young men, and they rise and go together unto Beer-Sheba; and Abraham dwelleth in Beer-Sheba."
9765,ylt,"And it cometh to pass after these things that it is declared to Abraham, saying, `Lo, Milcah hath borne, even she, sons to Nahor thy brother:"
9766,ylt,"Huz his first-born, and Buz his brother; and Kemuel father of Aram,"
9767,ylt,"and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel;"
9768,ylt,"and Bethuel hath begotten Rebekah;' these eight hath Milcah borne to Nahor, Abraham's brother;"
9769,ylt,"and his concubine, whose name `is' Reumah, she also hath borne Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maachah."
9770,ylt,And the life of Sarah is a hundred and twenty and seven years -- years of the life of Sarah;
9771,ylt,"and Sarah dieth in Kirjath-Arba, which `is' Hebron, in the land of Caanan, and Abraham goeth in to mourn for Sarah, and to bewail her."
9772,ylt,"And Abraham riseth up from the presence of his dead, and speaketh unto the sons of Heth, saying,"
9773,ylt,"`A sojourner and a settler I `am' with you; give to me a possession of a burying-place with you, and I bury my dead from before me.'"
9774,ylt,"And the sons of Heth answer Abraham, saying to him,"
9775,ylt,"`Hear us, my lord; a prince of God `art' thou in our midst; in the choice of our burying-places bury thy dead: none of us his burying-place doth withhold from thee, from burying thy dead.'"
9776,ylt,"And Abraham riseth and boweth himself to the people of the land, to the sons of Heth,"
9777,ylt,"and he speaketh with them, saying, `If it is your desire to bury my dead from before me, hear me, and meet for me with Ephron, son of Zoar;"
9778,ylt,"and he giveth to me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which `is' in the extremity of his field; for full money doth he give it to me, in your midst, for a possession of a burying-place.'"
9779,ylt,"And Ephron is sitting in the midst of the sons of Heth, and Ephron the Hittite answereth Abraham in the ears of the sons of Heth, of all those entering the gate of his city, saying,"
9780,ylt,"`Nay, my lord, hear me: the field I have given to thee, and the cave that `is' in it, to thee I have given it; before the eyes of the sons of my people I have given it to thee -- bury thy dead.'"
9781,ylt,"And Abraham boweth himself before the people of the land,"
9782,ylt,"and speaketh unto Ephron in the ears of the people of the land, saying, `Only -- if thou wouldst hear me -- I have given the money of the field -- accept from me, and I bury my dead there.'"
9783,ylt,"And Ephron answereth Abraham, saying to him,"
9784,ylt,"`My lord, hear me: the land -- four hundred shekels of silver; between me and thee, what `is' it? -- thy dead bury.'"
9785,ylt,"And Abraham hearkeneth unto Ephron, and Abraham weigheth to Ephron the silver which he hath spoken of in the ears of the sons of Heth, four hundred silver shekels, passing with the merchant."
9786,ylt,"And established are the field of Ephron, which `is' in Machpelah, which `is' before Mamre, the field and the cave which `is' in it, and all the trees which `are' in the field, which `are' in all its border round about,"
9787,ylt,"to Abraham by purchase, before the eyes of the sons of Heth, among all entering the gate of his city."
9788,ylt,"And after this hath Abraham buried Sarah his wife at the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (which `is' Hebron), in the land of Canaan;"
9789,ylt,"and established are the field, and the cave which `is' in it, to Abraham for a possession of a burying-place, from the sons of Heth."
9790,ylt,"And Abraham `is' old, he hath entered into days, and Jehovah hath blessed Abraham in all `things';"
9791,ylt,"and Abraham saith unto his servant, the eldest of his house, who is ruling over all that he hath, `Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh,"
9792,ylt,"and I cause thee to swear by Jehovah, God of the heavens, and God of the earth, that thou dost not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanite, in the midst of whom I am dwelling;"
9793,ylt,"but unto my land and unto my kindred dost thou go, and hast taken a wife for my son, for Isaac.'"
9794,ylt,"And the servant saith unto him, `It may be the woman is not willing to come after me unto this land; do I at all cause thy son to turn back unto the land from whence thou camest out?'"
9795,ylt,"And Abraham saith unto him, `Take heed to thyself, lest thou cause my son to turn back thither;"
9796,ylt,"Jehovah, God of the heavens, who hath taken me from the house of my father, and from the land of my birth, and who hath spoken to me, and who hath sworn to me, saying, To thy seed I give this land, He doth send His messenger before thee, and thou hast taken a wife for my son from thence;"
9797,ylt,"and if the woman be not willing to come after thee, then thou hast been acquitted from this mine oath: only my son thou dost not cause to turn back thither.'"
9798,ylt,"And the servant putteth his hand under the thigh of Abraham his lord, and sweareth to him concerning this matter."
9799,ylt,"And the servant taketh ten camels of the camels of his lord and goeth, also of all the goods of his lord in his hand, and he riseth, and goeth unto Aram-Naharaim, unto the city of Nahor;"
9800,ylt,"and he causeth the camels to kneel at the outside of the city, at the well of water, at even-time, at the time of the coming out of the women who draw water."
9801,ylt,"And he saith, `Jehovah, God of my lord Abraham, cause to meet, I pray Thee, before me this day -- (and do kindness with my lord Abraham;"
9802,ylt,"lo, I am standing by the fountain of water, and daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water;"
9803,ylt,"and it hath been, the young person unto whom I say, Incline, I pray thee, thy pitcher, and I drink, and she hath said, Drink, and I water also thy camels) -- her Thou hast decided for Thy servant, for Isaac; and by it I know that Thou hast done kindness with my lord.'"
9804,ylt,"And it cometh to pass, before he hath finished speaking, that lo, Rebekah (who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, wife of Nahor, brother of Abraham) is coming out, and her pitcher on her shoulder,"
9805,ylt,"and the young person `is' of very good appearance, a virgin, and a man hath not known her; and she goeth down to the fountain, and filleth her pitcher, and cometh up."
9806,ylt,"And the servant runneth to meet her, and saith, `Let me swallow, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher;'"
9807,ylt,"and she saith, `Drink, my lord;' and she hasteth, and letteth down her pitcher upon her hand, and giveth him drink."
9808,ylt,"And she finisheth giving him drink, and saith, `Also for thy camels I draw till they have finished drinking;'"
9809,ylt,"and she hasteth, and emptieth her pitcher into the drinking-trough, and runneth again unto the well to draw, and draweth for all his camels."
9810,ylt,"And the man, wondering at her, remaineth silent, to know whether Jehovah hath made his way prosperous or not."
9811,ylt,"And it cometh to pass when the camels have finished drinking, that the man taketh a golden ring (whose weight `is' a bekah), and two bracelets for her hands (whose weight `is' ten `bekahs' of gold),"
9812,ylt,"and saith, `Whose daughter `art' thou? declare to me, I pray thee, is the house of thy father a place for us to lodge in?'"
9813,ylt,"And she saith unto him, `I `am' daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, whom she hath borne to Nahor.'"
9814,ylt,"She saith also unto him, `Both straw and provender `are' abundant with us, also a place to lodge in.'"
9815,ylt,"And the man boweth, and doth obeisance to Jehovah,"
9816,ylt,"and saith, `Blessed `is' Jehovah, God of my lord Abraham, who hath not left off His kindness and His truth with my lord; -- I `being' in the way, Jehovah hath led me to the house of my lord's brethren.'"
9817,ylt,"And the young person runneth, and declareth to the house of her mother according to these words."
9818,ylt,"And Rebekah hath a brother, and his name `is' Laban, and Laban runneth unto the man who `is' without, unto the fountain;"
9819,ylt,"yea, it cometh to pass, when he seeth the ring, and the bracelets on the hands of his sister, and when he heareth the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, `Thus hath the man spoken unto me,' that he cometh in unto the man, and lo, he is standing by the camels by the fountain."
9820,ylt,"And he saith, `Come in, O blessed one of Jehovah, why standest thou without, and I -- I have prepared the house and place for the camels!'"
9821,ylt,"And he bringeth in the man into the house, and looseth the camels, and giveth straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of the men who `are' with him:"
9822,ylt,"and setteth before him to eat; but he saith, `I do not eat till I have spoken my word;' and he saith, `Speak.'"
9823,ylt,"And he saith, `I `am' Abraham's servant;"
9824,ylt,"and Jehovah hath blessed my lord exceedingly, and he is great; and He giveth to him flock, and herd, and silver, and gold, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and camels, and asses;"
9825,ylt,"and Sarah, my lord's wife, beareth a son to my lord, after she hath been aged, and he giveth to him all that he hath."
9826,ylt,"`And my lord causeth me to swear, saying, Thou dost not take a wife to my son from the daughters of the Canaanite, in whose land I am dwelling."
9827,ylt,"If not -- unto the house of my father thou dost go, and unto my family, and thou hast taken a wife for my son."
9828,ylt,"`And I say unto my lord, It may be the woman doth not come after me;"
9829,ylt,"and he saith unto me, Jehovah, before whom I have walked habitually, doth send His messenger with thee, and hath prospered thy way, and thou hast taken a wife for my son from my family, and from the house of my father;"
9830,ylt,"then art thou acquitted from my oath, when thou comest unto my family, and if they give not `one' to thee; then thou hast been acquitted from my oath."
9831,ylt,"`And I come to-day unto the fountain, and I say, Jehovah, God of my lord Abraham, if Thou art, I pray Thee, making prosperous my way in which I am going --"
9832,ylt,"(lo, I am standing by the fountain of water), then the virgin who is coming out to draw, and I have said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher,"
9833,ylt,"and she hath said unto me, Both drink thou, and also for thy camels I draw -- she is the woman whom Jehovah hath decided for my lord's son."
9834,ylt,"`Before I finish speaking unto my heart, then lo, Rebekah is coming out, and her pitcher on her shoulder, and she goeth down to the fountain, and draweth; and I say unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee,"
9835,ylt,"and she hasteth and letteth down her pitcher from off her and saith, Drink, and thy camels also I water; and I drink, and the camels also she hath watered."
9836,ylt,"`And I ask her, and say, Whose daughter `art' thou? and she saith, Daughter of Bethuel, son of Nahor, whom Milcah hath borne to him, and I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands,"
9837,ylt,"and I bow, and do obeisance before Jehovah, and I bless Jehovah, God of my lord Abraham, who hath led me in the true way to receive the daughter of my lord's brother for his son."
9838,ylt,"`And now, if ye are dealing kindly and truly with my lord, declare to me; and if not, declare to me; and I turn unto the right or unto the left.'"
9839,ylt,"And Laban answereth -- Bethuel also -- and they say, `The thing hath gone out from Jehovah; we are not able to speak unto thee bad or good;"
9840,ylt,"lo, Rebekah `is' before thee, take and go, and she is a wife to thy lord's son, as Jehovah hath spoken.'"
9841,ylt,"And it cometh to pass, when the servant of Abraham hath heard their words, that he boweth himself towards the earth before Jehovah;"
9842,ylt,"and the servant taketh out vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and giveth to Rebekah; precious things also he hath given to her brother and to her mother."
9843,ylt,"And they eat and drink, he and the men who `are' with him, and lodge all night; and they rise in the morning, and he saith, `Send me to my lord;'"
9844,ylt,"and her brother saith -- her mother also -- `Let the young person abide with us a week or ten days, afterwards doth she go.'"
9845,ylt,"And he saith unto them, `Do not delay me, seeing Jehovah hath prospered my way; send me away, and I go to my lord;'"
9846,ylt,"and they say, `Let us call for the young person, and ask at her mouth;'"
9847,ylt,"and they call for Rebekah, and say unto her, `Dost thou go with this man?' and she saith, `I go.'"
9848,ylt,"And they send away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men;"
9849,ylt,"and they bless Rebekah, and say to her, `Thou `art' our sister; become thou thousands of myriads, and thy seed doth possess the gate of those hating it.'"
9850,ylt,"And Rebekah and her young women arise, and ride on the camels, and go after the man; and the servant taketh Rebekah and goeth."
9851,ylt,"And Isaac hath come in from the entrance of the Well of the Living One, my Beholder; and he is dwelling in the land of the south,"
9852,ylt,"and Isaac goeth out to meditate in the field, at the turning of the evening, and he lifteth up his eyes, and looketh, and lo, camels are coming."
9853,ylt,"And Rebekah lifteth up her eyes, and seeth Isaac, and alighteth from off the camel;"
9854,ylt,"and she saith unto the servant, `Who `is' this man who is walking in the field to meet us?' and the servant saith, `It `is' my lord;' and she taketh the veil, and covereth herself."
9855,ylt,"And the servant recounteth to Isaac all the things that he hath done,"
9856,ylt,"and Isaac bringeth her in unto the tent of Sarah his mother, and he taketh Rebekah, and she becometh his wife, and he loveth her, and Isaac is comforted after `the death of' his mother."
9857,ylt,"And Abraham addeth and taketh a wife, and her name `is' Keturah;"
9858,ylt,"and she beareth to him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah."
9859,ylt,"And Jokshan hath begotten Sheba and Dedan; and the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim;"
9860,ylt,"and the sons of Midian `are' Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah: all these `are' sons of Keturah."
9861,ylt,And Abraham giveth all that he hath to Isaac;
9862,ylt,"and to the sons of the concubines whom Abraham hath, Abraham hath given gifts, and sendeth them away from Isaac his son (in his being yet alive) eastward, unto the east country."
9863,ylt,"And these `are' the days of the years of the life of Abraham, which he lived, a hundred and seventy and five years;"
9864,ylt,"and Abraham expireth, and dieth in a good old age, aged and satisfied, and is gathered unto his people."
9865,ylt,"And Isaac and Ishmael his sons bury him at the cave of Machpelah, at the field of Ephron, son of Zoar the Hittite, which `is' before Mamre --"
9866,ylt,"the field which Abraham bought from the sons of Heth -- there hath Abraham been buried, and Sarah his wife."
9867,ylt,"And it cometh to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blesseth Isaac his son; and Isaac dwelleth by the Well of the Living One, my Beholder."
9868,ylt,"And these `are' births of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, hath borne to Abraham;"
9869,ylt,"and these `are' the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their births: first-born of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,"
9870,ylt,"and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,"
9871,ylt,"Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:"
9872,ylt,"these are sons of Ishmael, and these their names, by their villages, and by their towers; twelve princes according to their peoples."
9873,ylt,"And these `are' the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and seven years; and he expireth, and dieth, and is gathered unto his people;"
9874,ylt,"and they tabernacle from Havilah unto Shur, which `is' before Egypt, in `thy' going towards Asshur; in the presence of all his brethren hath he fallen."
9875,ylt,"And these `are' births of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham hath begotten Isaac;"
9876,ylt,"and Isaac is a son of forty years in his taking Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel the Aramaean, from Padan-Aram, sister of Laban the Aramaean, to him for a wife."
9877,ylt,"And Isaac maketh entreaty to Jehovah before his wife, for she `is' barren: and Jehovah is entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceiveth,"
9878,ylt,"and the children struggle together within her, and she saith, `If `it is' right -- why `am' I thus?' and she goeth to seek Jehovah."
9879,ylt,"And Jehovah saith to her, `Two nations `are' in thy womb, and two peoples from thy bowels are parted; and the `one' people than the `other' people is stronger; and the elder doth serve the younger.'"
9880,ylt,"And her days to bear are fulfilled, and lo, twins `are' in her womb;"
9881,ylt,"and the first cometh out all red as a hairy robe, and they call his name Esau;"
9882,ylt,"and afterwards hath his brother come out, and his hand is taking hold on Esau's heel, and one calleth his name Jacob; and Isaac `is' a son of sixty years in her bearing them."
9883,ylt,"And the youths grew, and Esau is a man acquainted `with' hunting, a man of the field; and Jacob `is' a plain man, inhabiting tents;"
9884,ylt,"and Isaac loveth Esau, for `his' hunting `is' in his mouth; and Rebekah is loving Jacob."
9885,ylt,"And Jacob boileth pottage, and Esau cometh in from the field, and he `is' weary;"
9886,ylt,"and Esau saith unto Jacob, `Let me eat, I pray thee, some of this red red thing, for I `am' weary;' therefore hath `one' called his name Edom `Red';"
9887,ylt,"and Jacob saith, `Sell to-day thy birthright to me.'"
9888,ylt,"And Esau saith, `Lo, I am going to die, and what is this to me -- birthright?'"
9889,ylt,"and Jacob saith, `Swear to me to-day:' and he sweareth to him, and selleth his birthright to Jacob;"
9890,ylt,"and Jacob hath given to Esau bread and pottage of lentiles, and he eateth, and drinketh, and riseth, and goeth; and Esau despiseth the birthright."
9891,ylt,"And there is a famine in the land, besides the first famine which was in the days of Abraham, and Isaac goeth unto Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar."
9892,ylt,"And Jehovah appeareth unto him, and saith, `Go not down towards Egypt, tabernacle in the land concerning which I speak unto thee,"
9893,ylt,"sojourn in this land, and I am with thee, and bless thee, for to thee and to thy seed I give all these lands, and I have established the oath which I have sworn to Abraham thy father;"
9894,ylt,"and I have multiplied thy seed as stars of the heavens, and I have given to thy seed all these lands; and blessed themselves in thy seed have all nations of the earth;"
9895,ylt,"because that Abraham hath hearkened to My voice, and keepeth My charge, My commands, My statutes, and My laws.'"
9896,ylt,And Isaac dwelleth in Gerar;
9897,ylt,"and men of the place ask him of his wife, and he saith, `She `is' my sister:' for he hath been afraid to say, `My wife -- lest the men of the place kill me for Rebekah, for she `is' of good appearance.'"
9898,ylt,"And it cometh to pass, when the days have been prolonged to him there, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looketh through the window, and seeth, and lo, Isaac is playing with Rebekah his wife."
9899,ylt,"And Abimelech calleth for Isaac, and saith, `Lo, she `is' surely thy wife; and how hast thou said, She `is' my sister?' and Isaac saith unto him, `Because I said, Lest I die for her.'"
9900,ylt,"And Abimelech saith, `What `is' this thou hast done to us? as a little thing one of the people had lain with thy wife, and thou hadst brought upon us guilt;'"
9901,ylt,"and Abimelech commandeth all the people, saying, `He who cometh against this man or against his wife, dying doth die.'"
9902,ylt,"And Isaac soweth in that land, and findeth in that year a hundredfold, and Jehovah blesseth him;"
9903,ylt,"and the man is great, and goeth on, going on and becoming great, till that he hath been very great,"
9904,ylt,"and he hath possession of a flock, and possession of a herd, and an abundant service; and the Philistines envy him,"
9905,ylt,"and all the wells which his father's servants digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines have stopped them, and fill them with dust."
9906,ylt,"And Abimelech saith unto Isaac, `Go from us; for thou hast become much mightier than we;'"
9907,ylt,"and Isaac goeth from thence, and encampeth in the valley of Gerar, and dwelleth there;"
9908,ylt,"and Isaac turneth back, and diggeth the wells of water which they digged in the days of Abraham his father, which the Philistines do stop after the death of Abraham, and he calleth to them names according to the names which his father called them."
9909,ylt,"And Isaac's servants dig in the valley, and find there a well of living water,"
9910,ylt,"and shepherds of Gerar strive with shepherds of Isaac, saying, `The water `is' ours;' and he calleth the name of the well `Strife,' because they have striven habitually with him;"
9911,ylt,"and they dig another well, and they strive also for it, and he calleth its name `Hatred.'"
9912,ylt,"And he removeth from thence, and diggeth another well, and they have not striven for it, and he calleth its name Enlargements, and saith, `For -- now hath Jehovah given enlargement to us, and we have been fruitful in the land.'"
9913,ylt,"And he goeth up from thence `to' Beer-Sheba,"
9914,ylt,"and Jehovah appeareth unto him during that night, and saith, `I `am' the God of Abraham thy father, fear not, for I `am' with thee, and have blessed thee, and have multiplied thy seed, because of Abraham My servant;'"
9915,ylt,"and he buildeth there an altar, and preacheth in the name of Jehovah, and stretcheth out there his tent, and there Isaac's servants dig a well."
9916,ylt,"And Abimelech hath gone unto him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phichol head of his host;"
9917,ylt,"and Isaac saith unto them, `Wherefore have ye come unto me, and ye have hated me, and ye send me away from you?'"
9918,ylt,"And they say, `We have certainly seen that Jehovah hath been with thee, and we say, `Let there be, we pray thee, an oath between us, between us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;"
9919,ylt,"do not evil with us, as we have not touched thee, and as we have only done good with thee, and send thee away in peace; thou `art' now blessed of Jehovah.'"
9920,ylt,"And he maketh for them a banquet, and they eat and drink,"
9921,ylt,"and rise early in the morning, and swear one to another, and Isaac sendeth them away, and they go from him in peace."
9922,ylt,"And it cometh to pass during that day that Isaac's servants come and declare to him concerning the circumstances of the well which they have digged, and say to him, `We have found water;'"
9923,ylt,"and he calleth it Shebah, `oath,' therefore the name of the city `is' Beer-Sheba, `well of the oath,' unto this day."
9924,ylt,"And Esau is a son of forty years, and he taketh a wife, Judith, daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath, daughter of Elon the Hittite,"
9925,ylt,and they are a bitterness of spirit to Isaac and to Rebekah.
9926,ylt,"And it cometh to pass that Isaac `is' aged, and his eyes are too dim for seeing, and he calleth Esau his elder son, and saith unto him, `My son;' and he saith unto him, `Here `am' I.'"
9927,ylt,"And he saith, `Lo, I pray thee, I have become aged, I have not known the day of my death;"
9928,ylt,"and now, take up, I pray thee, thy instruments, thy quiver, and thy bow, and go out to the field, and hunt for me provision,"
9929,ylt,"and make for me tasteful things, `such' as I have loved, and bring in to me, and I do eat, so that my soul doth bless thee before I die.'"
9930,ylt,And Rebekah is hearkening while Isaac is speaking unto Esau his son; and Esau goeth to the field to hunt provision -- to bring in;
9931,ylt,"and Rebekah hath spoken unto Jacob her son, saying, `Lo, I have heard thy father speaking unto Esau thy brother, saying,"
9932,ylt,"Bring for me provision, and make for me tasteful things, and I do eat, and bless thee before Jehovah before my death."
9933,ylt,"`And now, my son, hearken to my voice, to that which I am commanding thee:"
9934,ylt,"Go, I pray thee, unto the flock, and take for me from thence two good kids of the goats, and I make them tasteful things for thy father, `such' as he hath loved;"
9935,ylt,"and thou hast taken in to thy father, and he hath eaten, so that his soul doth bless thee before his death."
9936,ylt,"And Jacob saith unto Rebekah his mother, `Lo, Esau my brother `is' a hairy man, and I a smooth man,"
9937,ylt,"it may be my father doth feel me, and I have been in his eyes as a deceiver, and have brought upon me disesteem, and not a blessing;'"
9938,ylt,"and his mother saith to him, `On me thy disesteem, my son; only hearken to my voice, and go, take for me.'"
9939,ylt,"And he goeth, and taketh, and bringeth to his mother, and his mother maketh tasteful things, `such' as his father hath loved;"
9940,ylt,"and Rebekah taketh the desirable garments of Esau her elder son, which `are' with her in the house, and doth put on Jacob her younger son;"
9941,ylt,"and the skins of the kids of the goats she hath put on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck,"
9942,ylt,"and she giveth the tasteful things, and the bread which she hath made, into the hand of Jacob her son."
9943,ylt,"And he cometh in unto his father, and saith, `My father;' and he saith, `Here `am' I; who `art' thou, my son?'"
9944,ylt,"And Jacob saith unto his father, `I `am' Esau thy first-born; I have done as thou hast spoken unto me; rise, I pray thee, sit, and eat of my provision, so that thy soul doth bless me.'"
9945,ylt,"And Isaac saith unto his son, `What `is' this thou hast hasted to find, my son?' and he saith, `That which Jehovah thy God hath caused to come before me.'"
9946,ylt,"And Isaac saith unto Jacob, `Come nigh, I pray thee, and I feel thee, my son, whether thou `art' he, my son Esau, or not.'"
9947,ylt,"And Jacob cometh nigh unto Isaac his father, and he feeleth him, and saith, `The voice `is' the voice of Jacob, and the hands hands of Esau.'"
9948,ylt,"And he hath not discerned him, for his hands have been hairy, as the hands of Esau his brother, and he blesseth him,"
9949,ylt,"and saith, `Thou art he -- my son Esau?' and he saith, `I `am'.'"
9950,ylt,"And he saith, `Bring nigh to me, and I do eat of my son's provision, so that my soul doth bless thee;' and he bringeth nigh to him, and he eateth; and he bringeth to him wine, and he drinketh."
9951,ylt,"And Isaac his father saith to him, `Come nigh, I pray thee, and kiss me, my son;'"
9952,ylt,"and he cometh nigh, and kisseth him, and he smelleth the fragrance of his garments, and blesseth him, and saith, `See, the fragrance of my son `is' as the fragrance of a field which Jehovah hath blessed;"
9953,ylt,"and God doth give to thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, and abundance of corn and wine;"
9954,ylt,"peoples serve thee, and nations bow themselves to thee, be thou mighty over thy brethren, and the sons of thy mother bow themselves to thee; those who curse thee `are' cursed, and those who bless thee `are' blessed.'"
9955,ylt,"And it cometh to pass, as Isaac hath finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob is only just going out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother hath come in from his hunting;"
9956,ylt,"and he also maketh tasteful things, and bringeth to his father, and saith to his father, `Let my father arise, and eat of his son's provision, so that thy soul doth bless me.'"
9957,ylt,"And Isaac his father saith to him, `Who `art' thou?' and he saith, `I `am' thy son, thy first-born, Esau;'"
9958,ylt,"and Isaac trembleth a very great trembling, and saith, `Who, now, `is' he who hath provided provision, and bringeth in to me, and I eat of all before thou comest in, and I bless him? -- yea, blessed is he.'"
9959,ylt,"When Esau heareth the words of his father, then he crieth a very great and bitter cry, and saith to his father, `Bless me, me also, O my father;'"
9960,ylt,"and he saith, `Thy brother hath come with subtilty, and taketh thy blessing.'"
9961,ylt,"And he saith, `Is it because `one' called his name Jacob that he doth take me by the heel these two times? my birthright he hath taken; and lo, now, he hath taken my blessing;' he saith also, `Hast thou not kept back a blessing for me?'"
9962,ylt,"And Isaac answereth and saith to Esau, `Lo, a mighty one have I set him over thee, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants, and `with' corn and wine have I sustained him; and for thee now, what shall I do, my son?'"
9963,ylt,"And Esau saith unto his father, `One blessing hast thou my father? bless me, me also, O my father;' and Esau lifteth up his voice, and weepeth."
9964,ylt,"And Isaac his father answereth and saith unto him, `Lo, of the fatness of the earth is thy dwelling, and of the dew of the heavens from above;"
9965,ylt,"and by thy sword dost thou live, and thy brother dost thou serve; and it hath come to pass when thou rulest, that thou hast broken his yoke from off thy neck.'"
9966,ylt,"And Esau hateth Jacob, because of the blessing with which his father blessed him, and Esau saith in his heart, `The days of mourning `for' my father draw near, and I slay Jacob my brother.'"
9967,ylt,"And the words of Esau her elder son are declared to Rebekah, and she sendeth and calleth for Jacob her younger son, and saith unto him, `Lo, Esau thy brother is comforting himself in regard to thee -- to slay thee;"
9968,ylt,"and now, my son, hearken to my voice, and rise, flee for thyself unto Laban my brother, to Haran,"
9969,ylt,"and thou hast dwelt with him some days, till thy brother's fury turn back,"
9970,ylt,"till thy brother's anger turn back from thee, and he hath forgotten that which thou hast done to him, and I have sent and taken thee from thence; why am I bereaved even of you both the same day?'"
9971,ylt,"And Rebekah saith unto Isaac, `I have been disgusted with my life because of the presence of the daughters of Heth; if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, like these -- from the daughters of the land -- why do I live?'"
9972,ylt,"And Isaac calleth unto Jacob, and blesseth him, and commandeth him, and saith to him, `Thou dost not take a wife of the daughters of Caanan;"
9973,ylt,"rise, go to Padan-Aram, to the house of Bethuel, thy mother's father, and take for thyself from thence a wife, of the daughters of Laban, thy mother's brother;"
9974,ylt,"and God Almighty doth bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and thou hast become an assembly of peoples;"
9975,ylt,"and He doth give to thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee and to thy seed with thee, to cause thee to possess the land of thy sojournings, which God gave to Abraham.'"
9976,ylt,"And Isaac sendeth away Jacob, and he goeth to Padan-Aram, unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramaean, brother of Rebekah, mother of Jacob and Esau."
9977,ylt,"And Esau seeth that Isaac hath blessed Jacob, and hath sent him to Padan-Aram to take to himself from thence a wife -- in his blessing him that he layeth a charge upon him, saying, Thou dost not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan --"
9978,ylt,"that Jacob hearkeneth unto his father and unto his mother, and goeth to Padan-Aram --"
9979,ylt,"and Esau seeth that the daughters of Canaan are evil in the eyes of Isaac his father,"
9980,ylt,"and Esau goeth unto Ishmael, and taketh Mahalath, daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, sister of Nebajoth, unto his wives, to himself, for a wife."
9981,ylt,"And Jacob goeth out from Beer-Sheba, and goeth toward Haran,"
9982,ylt,"and he toucheth at a `certain' place, and lodgeth there, for the sun hath gone in, and he taketh of the stones of the place, and maketh `them' his pillows, and lieth down in that place."
9983,ylt,"And he dreameth, and lo, a ladder set up on the earth, and its head is touching the heavens; and lo, messengers of God are going up and coming down by it;"
9984,ylt,"and lo, Jehovah is standing upon it, and He saith, `I `am' Jehovah, God of Abraham thy father, and God of Isaac; the land on which thou art lying, to thee I give it, and to thy seed;"
9985,ylt,"and thy seed hath been as the dust of the land, and thou hast broken forth westward, and eastward, and northward, and southward, and all families of the ground have been blessed in thee and in thy seed."
9986,ylt,"`And lo, I `am' with thee, and have kept thee whithersoever thou goest, and have caused thee to turn back unto this ground; for I leave thee not till that I have surely done that which I have spoken to thee.'"
9987,ylt,"And Jacob awaketh out of his sleep, and saith, `Surely Jehovah is in this place, and I knew not;'"
9988,ylt,"and he feareth, and saith, `How fearful `is' this place; this is nothing but a house of God, and this a gate of the heavens.'"
9989,ylt,"And Jacob riseth early in the morning, and taketh the stone which he hath made his pillows, and maketh it a standing pillar, and poureth oil upon its top,"
9990,ylt,"and he calleth the name of that place Bethel, `house of God,' and yet, Luz `is' the name of the city at the first."
9991,ylt,"And Jacob voweth a vow, saying, `Seeing God is with me, and hath kept me in this way which I am going, and hath given to me bread to eat, and a garment to put on --"
9992,ylt,"when I have turned back in peace unto the house of my father, and Jehovah hath become my God,"
9993,ylt,"then this stone which I have made a standing pillar is a house of God, and all that Thou dost give to me -- tithing I tithe to Thee.'"
9994,ylt,"And Jacob lifteth up his feet, and goeth towards the land of the sons of the east;"
9995,ylt,"and he looketh, and lo, a well in the field, and lo, there three droves of a flock crouching by it, for from that well they water the droves, and the great stone `is' on the mouth of the well."
9996,ylt,"(When thither have all the droves been gathered, and they have rolled the stone from off the mouth of the well, and have watered the flock, then they have turned back the stone on the mouth of the well to its place.)"
9997,ylt,"And Jacob saith to them, `My brethren, from whence `are' ye?' and they say, `We `are' from Haran.'"
9998,ylt,"And he saith to them, `Have ye known Laban, son of Nahor?' and they say, `We have known.'"
9999,ylt,"And he saith to them, `Hath he peace?' and they say, `Peace; and lo, Rachel his daughter is coming with the flock.'"
10000,ylt,"And he saith, `Lo, the day `is' still great, `it is' not time for the cattle to be gathered; water ye the flock, and go, delight yourselves.'"
10001,ylt,"And they say, `We are not able, till that all the droves be gathered together, and they have rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well, and we have watered the flock.'"
10002,ylt,"He is yet speaking with them, and Rachel hath come with the flock which her father hath, for she `is' shepherdess;"
10003,ylt,"and it cometh to pass when Jacob hath seen Rachel, daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the flock of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob cometh nigh and rolleth the stone from off the mouth of the well, and watereth the flock of Laban his mother's brother."
10004,ylt,"And Jacob kisseth Rachel, and lifteth up his voice, and weepeth,"
10005,ylt,"and Jacob declareth to Rachel that he `is' her father's brother, and that he `is' Rebekah's son, and she runneth and declareth to her father."
10006,ylt,"And it cometh to pass, when Laban heareth the report of Jacob his sister's son, that he runneth to meet him, and embraceth him, and kisseth him, and bringeth him in unto his house; and he recounteth to Laban all these things,"
10007,ylt,"and Laban saith to him, `Only my bone and my flesh `art' thou;' and he dwelleth with him a month of days."
10008,ylt,"And Laban saith to Jacob, `Is it because thou `art' my brother that thou hast served me for nought? declare to me what `is' thy hire.'"
10009,ylt,"And Laban hath two daughters, the name of the elder `is' Leah, and the name of the younger Rachel,"
10010,ylt,"and the eyes of Leah `are' tender, and Rachel hath been fair of form and fair of appearance."
10011,ylt,"And Jacob loveth Rachel, and saith, `I serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter:'"
10012,ylt,"and Laban saith, `It is better for me to give her to thee than to give her to another man; dwell with me;'"
10013,ylt,"and Jacob serveth for Rachel seven years; and they are in his eyes as some days, because of his loving her."
10014,ylt,"And Jacob saith unto Laban, `Give up my wife, for my days have been fulfilled, and I go in unto her;'"
10015,ylt,"and Laban gathereth all the men of the place, and maketh a banquet."
10016,ylt,"And it cometh to pass in the evening, that he taketh Leah, his daughter, and bringeth her in unto him, and he goeth in unto her;"
10017,ylt,"and Laban giveth to her Zilpah, his maid-servant, to Leah his daughter, a maid-servant."
10018,ylt,"And it cometh to pass in the morning, that lo, it `is' Leah; and he saith unto Laban, `What `is' this thou hast done to me? for Rachel have I not served with thee? and why hast thou deceived me?'"
10019,ylt,"And Laban saith, `It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the first-born;"
10020,ylt,"fulfil the week of this one, and we give to thee also this one, for the service which thou dost serve with me yet seven other years.'"
10021,ylt,"And Jacob doth so, and fulfilleth the week of this one, and he giveth to him Rachel his daughter, to him for a wife;"
10022,ylt,"and Laban giveth to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his maid-servant, for a maid-servant to her."
10023,ylt,"And he goeth in also unto Rachel, and he also loveth Rachel more than Leah; and he serveth with him yet seven other years."
10024,ylt,"And Jehovah seeth that Leah `is' the hated one, and He openeth her womb, and Rachel `is' barren;"
10025,ylt,"and Leah conceiveth, and beareth a son, and calleth his name Reuben, for she said, `Because Jehovah hath looked on mine affliction; because now doth my husband love me.'"
10026,ylt,"And she conceiveth again, and beareth a son, and saith, `Because Jehovah hath heard that I `am' the hated one, He also giveth to me even this `one';' and she calleth his name Simeon."
10027,ylt,"And she conceiveth again, and beareth a son, and saith, `Now `is' the time, my husband is joined unto me, because I have born to him three sons,' therefore hath `one' called his name Levi."
10028,ylt,"And she conceiveth again, and beareth a son, and saith this time, `I praise Jehovah;' therefore hath she called his name Judah; and she ceaseth from bearing."
10029,ylt,"And Rachel seeth that she hath not borne to Jacob, and Rachel is envious of her sister, and saith unto Jacob, `Give me sons, and if there is none -- I die.'"
10030,ylt,"And Jacob's anger burneth against Rachel, and he saith, `Am I in stead of God who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?'"
10031,ylt,"And she saith, `Lo, my handmaid Bilhah, go in unto her, and she doth bear on my knees, and I am built up, even I, from her;'"
10032,ylt,"and she giveth to him Bilhah her maid-servant for a wife, and Jacob goeth in unto her;"
10033,ylt,"and Bilhah conceiveth, and beareth to Jacob a son,"
10034,ylt,"and Rachel saith, `God hath decided for me, and also hath hearkened to my voice, and giveth to me a son;' therefore hath she called his name Dan."
10035,ylt,"And Bilhah, Rachel's maid-servant, conceiveth again, and beareth a second son to Jacob,"
10036,ylt,"and Rachel saith, `With wrestlings of God I have wrestled with my sister, yea, I have prevailed;' and she calleth his name Napthali."
10037,ylt,"And Leah seeth that she hath ceased from bearing, and she taketh Zilpah her maid-servant, and giveth her to Jacob for a wife;"
10038,ylt,"and Zilpah, Leah's maid-servant, beareth to Jacob a son,"
10039,ylt,"and Leah saith, `A troop is coming;' and she calleth his name Gad."
10040,ylt,"And Zilpah, Leah's maid-servant, beareth a second son to Jacob,"
10041,ylt,"and Leah saith, `Because of my happiness, for daughters have pronounced me happy;' and she calleth his name Asher."
10042,ylt,"And Reuben goeth in the days of wheat-harvest, and findeth love-apples in the field, and bringeth them in unto Leah, his mother, and Rachel saith unto Leah, `Give to me, I pray thee, of the love-apples of thy son.'"
10043,ylt,"And she saith to her, `Is thy taking my husband a little thing, that thou hast taken also the love-apples of my son?' and Rachel saith, `Therefore doth he lie with thee to-night, for thy son's love-apples.'"
10044,ylt,"And Jacob cometh in from the field at evening; and Leah goeth to meet him, and saith, `Unto me dost thou come in, for hiring I have hired thee with my son's love-apples;' and he lieth with her during that night."
10045,ylt,"And God hearkeneth unto Leah, and she conceiveth, and beareth to Jacob a son, a fifth,"
10046,ylt,"and Leah saith, `God hath given my hire, because I have given my maid-servant to my husband;' and she calleth his name Issachar."
10047,ylt,"And conceive again doth Leah, and she beareth a sixth son to Jacob,"
10048,ylt,"and Leah saith, `God hath endowed me -- a good dowry; this time doth my husband dwell with me, for I have borne to him six sons;' and she calleth his name Zebulun;"
10049,ylt,"and afterwards hath she born a daughter, and calleth her name Dinah."
10050,ylt,"And God remembereth Rachel, and God hearkeneth unto her, and openeth her womb,"
10051,ylt,"and she conceiveth and beareth a son, and saith, `God hath gathered up my reproach;'"
10052,ylt,"and she calleth his name Joseph, saying, `Jehovah is adding to me another son.'"
10053,ylt,"And it cometh to pass, when Rachel hath borne Joseph, that Jacob saith unto Laban, `Send me away, and I go unto my place, and to my land;"
10054,ylt,"give up my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and I go; for thou -- thou hast known my service which I have served thee.'"
10055,ylt,"And Laban saith unto him, `If, I pray thee, I have found grace in thine eyes -- I have observed diligently that Jehovah doth bless me for thy sake.'"
10056,ylt,"He saith also, `Define thy hire to me, and I give.'"
10057,ylt,"And he saith unto him, `Thou -- thou hast known that which I have served thee `in', and that which thy substance was with me;"
10058,ylt,"for `it is' little which thou hast had at my appearance, and it breaketh forth into a multitude, and Jehovah blesseth thee at my coming; and now, when do I make, I also, for mine own house?'"
10059,ylt,"And he saith, `What do I give to thee?' And Jacob saith, `Thou dost not give me anything; if thou do for me this thing, I turn back; I have delight; thy flock I watch;"
10060,ylt,"I pass through all thy flock to-day to turn aside from thence every sheep speckled and spotted, and every brown sheep among the lambs, and speckled and spotted among the goats -- and it hath been my hire;"
10061,ylt,"and my righteousness hath answered for me in the day to come, when it cometh in for my hire before thy face; -- every one which is not speckled and spotted among `my' goats, and brown among `my' lambs -- it is stolen with me.'"
10062,ylt,"And Laban saith, `Lo, O that it were according to thy word;'"
10063,ylt,"and he turneth aside during that day the ring-straked and the spotted he-goats, and all the speckled and the spotted she-goats, every one that `hath' white in it, and every brown one among the lambs, and he giveth into the hand of his sons,"
10064,ylt,and setteth a journey of three days between himself and Jacob; and Jacob is feeding the rest of the flock of Laban.
10065,ylt,"And Jacob taketh to himself a rod of fresh poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut, and doth peel in them white peelings, making bare the white that `is' on the rods,"
10066,ylt,"and setteth up the rods which he hath peeled in the gutters in the watering troughs (when the flock cometh in to drink), over-against the flock, that they may conceive in their coming in to drink;"
10067,ylt,"and the flocks conceive at the rods, and the flock beareth ring-straked, speckled, and spotted ones."
10068,ylt,"And the lambs hath Jacob parted, and he putteth the face of the flock towards the ring-straked, also all the brown in the flock of Laban, and he setteth his own droves by themselves, and hath not set them near Laban's flock."
10069,ylt,"And it hath come to pass whenever the strong ones of the flock conceive, that Jacob set the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, to cause them to conceive by the rods,"
10070,ylt,"and when the flock is feeble, he doth not set `them'; and the feeble ones have been Laban's, and the strong ones Jacob's."
10071,ylt,"And the man increaseth very exceedingly, and hath many flocks, and maid-servants, and men-servants, and camels, and asses."
10072,ylt,"And he heareth the words of Laban's sons, saying, `Jacob hath taken all that our father hath; yea, from that which our father hath, he hath made all this honour;'"
10073,ylt,"and Jacob seeth the face of Laban, and lo, it is not with him as heretofore."
10074,ylt,"And Jehovah saith unto Jacob, `Turn back unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred, and I am with thee.'"
10075,ylt,And Jacob sendeth and calleth for Rachel and for Leah to the field unto his flock;
10076,ylt,"and saith to them, `I am beholding your father's face -- that it is not towards me as heretofore, and the God of my father hath been with me,"
10077,ylt,"and ye -- ye have known that with all my power I have served your father,"
10078,ylt,"and your father hath played upon me, and hath changed my hire ten times; and God hath not suffered him to do evil with me."
10079,ylt,"`If he say thus: The speckled are thy hire, then bare all the flock speckled ones; and if he say thus: The ring-straked are thy hire, then bare all the flock ring-straked;"
10080,ylt,"and God taketh away the substance of your father, and doth give to me."
10081,ylt,"`And it cometh to pass at the time of the flock conceiving, that I lift up mine eyes and see in a dream, and lo, the he-goats, which are going up on the flock, `are' ring-straked, speckled, and grisled;"
10082,ylt,"and the messenger of God saith unto me in the dream, Jacob, and I say, Here `am' I."
10083,ylt,"`And He saith, Lift up, I pray thee, thine eyes, and see -- all the he-goats which are going up on the flock `are' ring-straked, speckled, and grisled, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to thee;"
10084,ylt,"I `am' the God of Bethel where thou hast anointed a standing pillar, where thou hast vowed a vow to me; now, arise, go out from this land, and turn back unto the land of thy birth.'"
10085,ylt,"And Rachel answereth -- Leah also -- and saith to him, `Have we yet a portion and inheritance in the house of our father?"
10086,ylt,"have we not been reckoned strangers to him? for he hath sold us, and he also utterly consumeth our money;"
10087,ylt,"for all the wealth which God hath taken away from our father, it `is' ours, and our children's; and now, all that God hath said unto thee -- do.'"
10088,ylt,"And Jacob riseth, and lifteth up his sons and his wives on the camels,"
10089,ylt,"and leadeth all his cattle, and all his substance which he hath acquired, the cattle of his getting, which he hath acquired in Padan-Aram, to go unto Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan."
10090,ylt,"And Laban hath gone to shear his flock, and Rachel stealeth the teraphim which her father hath;"
10091,ylt,"and Jacob deceiveth the heart of Laban the Aramaean, because he hath not declared to him that he is fleeing;"
10092,ylt,"and he fleeth, he and all that he hath, and riseth, and passeth over the River, and setteth his face `toward' the mount of Gilead."
10093,ylt,"And it is told to Laban on the third day that Jacob hath fled,"
10094,ylt,"and he taketh his brethren with him, and pursueth after him a journey of seven days, and overtaketh him in the mount of Gilead."
10095,ylt,"And God cometh in unto Laban the Aramaean in a dream of the night, and saith to him, `Take heed to thyself lest thou speak with Jacob from good unto evil.'"
10096,ylt,And Laban overtaketh Jacob; and Jacob hath fixed his tent in the mount; and Laban with his brethren have fixed `theirs' in the mount of Gilead.
10097,ylt,"And Laban saith to Jacob, `What hast thou done that thou dost deceive my heart, and lead away my daughters as captives of the sword?"
10098,ylt,"Why hast thou hidden thyself to flee, and deceivest me, and hast not declared to me, and I send thee away with joy and with songs, with tabret and with harp,"
10099,ylt,and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? -- now thou hast acted foolishly in doing `so';
10100,ylt,"my hand is to God to do evil with you, but the God of your father yesternight hath spoken unto me, saying, Take heed to thyself from speaking with Jacob from good unto evil."
10101,ylt,"`And now, thou hast certainly gone, because thou hast been very desirous for the house of thy father; why hast thou stolen my gods?'"
10102,ylt,"And Jacob answereth and saith to Laban, `Because I was afraid, for I said, Lest thou take violently away thy daughters from me;"
10103,ylt,"with whomsoever thou findest thy gods -- he doth not live; before our brethren discern for thyself what `is' with me, and take to thyself:' and Jacob hath not known that Rachel hath stolen them."
10104,ylt,"And Laban goeth into the tent of Jacob, and into the tent of Leah, and into the tent of the two handmaidens, and hath not found; and he goeth out from the tent of Leah, and goeth into the tent of Rachel."
10105,ylt,"And Rachel hath taken the teraphim, and putteth them in the furniture of the camel, and sitteth upon them; and Laban feeleth all the tent, and hath not found;"
10106,ylt,"and she saith unto her father, `Let it not be displeasing in the eyes of my lord that I am not able to rise at thy presence, for the way of women `is' on me;' and he searcheth, and hath not found the teraphim."
10107,ylt,"And it is displeasing to Jacob, and he striveth with Laban; and Jacob answereth and saith to Laban, `What `is' my transgression? what my sin, that thou hast burned after me?"
10108,ylt,"for thou hast felt all my vessels: what hast thou found of all the vessels of thy house? set here before my brethren, and thy brethren, and they decide between us both."
10109,ylt,"`These twenty years I `am' with thee: thy ewes and thy she-goats have not miscarried, and the rams of thy flock I have not eaten;"
10110,ylt,"the torn I have not brought in unto thee -- I, I repay it -- from my hand thou dost seek it; I have been deceived by day, and I have been deceived by night;"
10111,ylt,"I have been `thus': in the day consumed me hath drought, and frost by night, and wander doth my sleep from mine eyes."
10112,ylt,"`This `is' to me twenty years in thy house: I have served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock; and thou changest my hire ten times;"
10113,ylt,"unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been for me, surely now empty thou hadst sent me away; mine affliction and the labour of my hands hath God seen, and reproveth yesternight.'"
10114,ylt,"And Laban answereth and saith unto Jacob, `The daughters `are' my daughters, and the sons my sons, and the flock my flock, and all that thou art seeing `is' mine; and to my daughters -- what do I to these to-day, or to their sons whom they have born?"
10115,ylt,"and now, come, let us make a covenant, I and thou, and it hath been for a witness between me and thee.'"
10116,ylt,"And Jacob taketh a stone, and lifteth it up `for' a standing pillar;"
10117,ylt,"and Jacob saith to his brethren, `Gather stones,' and they take stones, and make a heap; and they eat there on the heap;"
10118,ylt,and Laban calleth it Jegar-Sahadutha; and Jacob hath called it Galeed.
10119,ylt,"And Laban saith, `This heap `is' witness between me and thee to-day;' therefore hath he called its name Galeed;"
10120,ylt,"Mizpah also, for he said, `Jehovah doth watch between me and thee, for we are hidden one from another;"
10121,ylt,"if thou afflict my daughters, or take wives beside my daughters -- there is no man with us -- see, God `is' witness between me and thee.'"
10122,ylt,"And Laban saith to Jacob, `Lo, this heap, and lo, the standing pillar which I have cast between me and thee;"
10123,ylt,"this heap `is' witness, and the standing pillar `is' witness, that I do not pass over this heap unto thee, and that thou dost not pass over this heap and this standing pillar unto me -- for evil;"
10124,ylt,"the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, doth judge between us -- the God of their father,' and Jacob sweareth by the Fear of his father Isaac."
10125,ylt,"And Jacob sacrificeth a sacrifice in the mount, and calleth to his brethren to eat bread, and they eat bread, and lodge in the mount;"
10126,ylt,"and Laban riseth early in the morning, and kisseth his sons and his daughters, and blesseth them; and Laban goeth on, and turneth back to his place."
10127,ylt,"And Jacob hath gone on his way, and messengers of God come upon him;"
10128,ylt,"and Jacob saith, when he hath seen them, `This `is' the camp of God;' and he calleth the name of that place `Two Camps.'"
10129,ylt,"And Jacob sendeth messengers before him unto Esau his brother, towards the land of Seir, the field of Edom,"
10130,ylt,"and commandeth them, saying, `Thus do ye say to my lord, to Esau: Thus said thy servant Jacob, With Laban I have sojourned, and I tarry until now;"
10131,ylt,"and I have ox, and ass, flock, and man-servant, and maid-servant, and I send to declare to my lord, to find grace in his eyes.'"
10132,ylt,"And the messengers turn back unto Jacob, saying, `We came in unto thy brother, unto Esau, and he also is coming to meet thee, and four hundred men with him;'"
10133,ylt,"and Jacob feareth exceedingly, and is distressed, and he divideth the people who `are' with him, and the flock, and the herd, and the camels, into two camps,"
10134,ylt,"and saith, `If Esau come in unto the one camp, and have smitten it -- then the camp which is left hath been for an escape.'"
10135,ylt,"And Jacob saith, `God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Jehovah who saith unto me, Turn back to thy land, and to thy kindred, and I do good with thee:"
10136,ylt,"I have been unworthy of all the kind acts, and of all the truth which Thou hast done with thy servant -- for, with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I have become two camps."
10137,ylt,"`Deliver me, I pray Thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I am fearing him, less he come and have smitten me -- mother beside sons;"
10138,ylt,"and Thou -- Thou hast said, I certainly do good with thee, and have set thy seed as the sand of the sea, which is not numbered because of the multitude.'"
10139,ylt,"And he lodgeth there during that night, and taketh from that which is coming into his hand, a present for Esau his brother:"
10140,ylt,"she-goats two hundred, and he-goats twenty, ewes two hundred, and rams twenty,"
10141,ylt,"suckling camels and their young ones thirty, cows forty, and bullocks ten, she-asses twenty, and foals ten;"
10142,ylt,"and he giveth into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and saith unto his servants, `Pass over before me, and a space ye do put between drove and drove.'"
10143,ylt,"And he commandeth the first, saying, `When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and hath asked thee, saying, Whose `art' thou? and whither goest thou? and whose `are' these before thee?"
10144,ylt,"then thou hast said, Thy servant Jacob's: it `is' a present sent to my lord, to Esau; and lo, he also `is' behind us.'"
10145,ylt,"And he commandeth also the second, also the third, also all who are going after the droves, saying, `According to this manner do ye speak unto Esau in your finding him,"
10146,ylt,"and ye have said also, Lo, thy servant Jacob `is' behind us;' for he said, `I pacify his face with the present which is going before me, and afterwards I see his face; it may be he lifteth up my face;'"
10147,ylt,"and the present passeth over before his face, and he hath lodged during that night in the camp."
10148,ylt,"And he riseth in that night, and taketh his two wives, and his two maid-servants, and his eleven children, and passeth over the passage of Jabbok;"
10149,ylt,"and he taketh them, and causeth them to pass over the brook, and he causeth that which he hath to pass over."
10150,ylt,"And Jacob is left alone, and one wrestleth with him till the ascending of the dawn;"
10151,ylt,"and he seeth that he is not able for him, and he cometh against the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob's thigh is disjointed in his wrestling with him;"
10152,ylt,"and he saith, `Send me away, for the dawn hath ascended:' and he saith, `I send thee not away, except thou hast blessed me.'"
10153,ylt,"And he saith unto him, `What `is' thy name?' and he saith, `Jacob.'"
10154,ylt,"And he saith, `Thy name is no more called Jacob, but Israel; for thou hast been a prince with God and with men, and dost prevail.'"
10155,ylt,"And Jacob asketh, and saith, `Declare, I pray thee, thy name;' and he saith, `Why `is' this, thou askest for My name?' and He blesseth him there."
10156,ylt,"And Jacob calleth the name of the place Peniel: for `I have seen God face unto face, and my life is delivered;'"
10157,ylt,"and the sun riseth on him when he hath passed over Penuel, and he is halting on his thigh;"
10158,ylt,"therefore the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew which shrank, which `is' on the hollow of the thigh, unto this day, because He came against the hollow of Jacob's thigh, against the sinew which shrank."
10159,ylt,"And Jacob lifteth up his eyes, and looketh, and lo, Esau is coming, and with him four hundred men; and he divideth the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two maid-servants;"
10160,ylt,"and he setteth the maid-servants and their children first, and Leah and her children behind, and Rachel and Joseph last."
10161,ylt,"And he himself passed over before them, and boweth himself to the earth seven times, until his drawing nigh unto his brother,"
10162,ylt,"and Esau runneth to meet him, and embraceth him, and falleth on his neck, and kisseth him, and they weep;"
10163,ylt,"and he lifteth up his eyes, and seeth the women and the children, and saith, `What `are' these to thee?' And he saith, `The children with whom God hath favoured thy servant.'"
10164,ylt,"And the maid-servants draw nigh, they and their children, and bow themselves;"
10165,ylt,"and Leah also draweth nigh, and her children, and they bow themselves; and afterwards Joseph hath drawn nigh with Rachel, and they bow themselves."
10166,ylt,"And he saith, `What to thee `is' all this camp which I have met?' and he saith, `To find grace in the eyes of my lord.'"
10167,ylt,"And Esau saith, `I have abundance, my brother, let it be to thyself that which thou hast.'"
10168,ylt,"And Jacob saith, `Nay, I pray thee, if, I pray thee, I have found grace in thine eyes, then thou hast received my present from my hand, because that I have seen thy face, as the seeing of the face of God, and thou art pleased with me;"
10169,ylt,"receive, I pray thee, my blessing, which is brought to thee, because God hath favoured me, and because I have all `things';' and he presseth on him, and he receiveth,"
10170,ylt,"and saith, `Let us journey and go on, and I go on before thee.'"
10171,ylt,"And he saith unto him, `My lord knoweth that the children `are' tender, and the suckling flock and the herd `are' with me; when they have beaten them one day, then hath all the flock died."
10172,ylt,"Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant, and I -- I lead on gently, according to the foot of the work which `is' before me, and to the foot of the children, until that I come unto my lord, to Seir.'"
10173,ylt,"And Esau saith, `Let me, I pray thee, place with thee some of the people who `are' with me;' and he said, `Why `is' this? I find grace in the eyes of my lord.'"
10174,ylt,And turn back on that day doth Esau on his way to Seir;
10175,ylt,"and Jacob hath journeyed to Succoth, and buildeth to himself a house, and for his cattle hath made booths, therefore hath he called the name of the place Succoth."
10176,ylt,"And Jacob cometh in to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which `is' in the land of Canaan, in his coming from Padan-Aram, and encampeth before the city,"
10177,ylt,"and he buyeth the portion of the field where he hath stretched out his tent, from the hand of the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, for a hundred kesitah;"
10178,ylt,"and he setteth up there an altar, and proclaimeth at it God -- the God of Israel."
10179,ylt,"And Dinah, daughter of Leah, whom she hath borne to Jacob, goeth out to look on the daughters of the land,"
10180,ylt,"and Shechem, son of Hamor the Hivite, a prince of the land, seeth her, and taketh her, and lieth with her, and humbleth her;"
10181,ylt,"and his soul cleaveth to Dinah, daughter of Jacob, and he loveth the young person, and speaketh unto the heart of the young person."
10182,ylt,"And Shechem speaketh unto Hamor his father, saying, `Take for me this damsel for a wife.'"
10183,ylt,"And Jacob hath heard that he hath defiled Dinah his daughter, and his sons were with his cattle in the field, and Jacob kept silent till their coming."
10184,ylt,"And Hamor, father of Shechem, goeth out unto Jacob to speak with him;"
10185,ylt,"and the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard, and the men grieve themselves, and it `is' very displeasing to them, for folly he hath done against Israel, to lie with the daughter of Jacob -- and so it is not done."
10186,ylt,"And Hamor speaketh with them, saying, `Shechem, my son, his soul hath cleaved to your daughter; give her, I pray you, to him for a wife,"
10187,ylt,"and join ye in marriage with us; your daughters ye give to us, and our daughters ye take to yourselves,"
10188,ylt,"and with us ye dwell, and the land is before you; dwell ye and trade `in' it, and have possessions in it.'"
10189,ylt,"And Shechem saith unto her father, and unto her brethren, `Let me find grace in your eyes, and that which ye say unto me, I give;"
10190,ylt,"multiply on me exceedingly dowry and gift, and I give as ye say unto me, and give to me the young person for a wife.'"
10191,ylt,"And the sons of Jacob answer Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and they speak (because he defiled Dinah their sister),"
10192,ylt,"and say unto them, `We are not able to do this thing, to give our sister to one who hath a foreskin: for it `is' a reproach to us."
10193,ylt,"`Only for this we consent to you; if ye be as we, to have every male of you circumcised,"
10194,ylt,"then we have given our daughters to you, and your daughters we take to ourselves, and we have dwelt with you, and have become one people;"
10195,ylt,"and if ye hearken not unto us to be circumcised, then we have taken our daughter, and have gone.'"
10196,ylt,"And their words are good in the eyes of Hamor, and in the eyes of Shechem, Hamor's son;"
10197,ylt,"and the young man delayed not to do the thing, for he had delight in Jacob's daughter, and he is honourable above all the house of his father."
10198,ylt,"And Hamor cometh -- Shechem his son also -- unto the gate of their city, and they speak unto the men of their city, saying,"
10199,ylt,"`These men are peaceable with us; then let them dwell in the land, and trade `in' it; and the land, lo, `is' wide before them; their daughters let us take to ourselves for wives, and our daughters give to them."
10200,ylt,"`Only for this do the men consent to us, to dwell with us, to become one people, in every male of us being circumcised, as they are circumcised;"
10201,ylt,"their cattle, and their substance, and all their beasts -- are they not ours? only let us consent to them, and they dwell with us.'"
10202,ylt,"And unto Hamor, and unto Shechem his son, hearken do all those going out of the gate of his city, and every male is circumcised, all those going out of the gate of his city."
10203,ylt,"And it cometh to pass, on the third day, in their being pained, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, take each his sword, and come in against the city confidently, and slay every male;"
10204,ylt,"and Hamor, and Shechem his son, they have slain by the mouth of the sword, and they take Dinah out of Shechem's house, and go out."
10205,ylt,"Jacob's sons have come in upon the wounded, and they spoil the city, because they had defiled their sister;"
10206,ylt,"their flock and their herd, and their asses, and that which `is' in the city, and that which `is' in the field, have they taken;"
10207,ylt,"and all their wealth, and all their infants, and their wives they have taken captive, and they spoil also all that `is' in the house."
10208,ylt,"And Jacob saith unto Simeon and unto Levi, `Ye have troubled me, by causing me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanite, and among the Perizzite: and I `am' few in number, and they have been gathered against me, and have smitten me, and I have been destroyed, I and my house.'"
10209,ylt,"And they say, `As a harlot doth he make our sister?'"
10210,ylt,"And God saith unto Jacob, `Rise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there, and make there an altar to God, who appeared unto thee in thy fleeing from the face of Esau thy brother.'"
10211,ylt,"And Jacob saith unto his household, and unto all who `are' with him, `Turn aside the gods of the stranger which `are' in your midst, and cleanse yourselves, and change your garments;"
10212,ylt,"and we rise, and go up to Bethel, and I make there an altar to God, who is answering me in the day of my distress, and is with me in the way that I have gone.'"
10213,ylt,"And they give unto Jacob all the gods of the stranger that `are' in their hand, and the rings that `are' in their ears, and Jacob hideth them under the oak which `is' by Shechem;"
10214,ylt,"and they journey, and the terror of God is on the cities which `are' round about them, and they have not pursued after the sons of Jacob."
10215,ylt,"And Jacob cometh in to Luz which `is' in the land of Canaan (it `is' Bethel), he and all the people who `are' with him,"
10216,ylt,"and he buildeth there an altar, and proclaimeth at the place the God of Bethel: for there had God been revealed unto him, in his fleeing from the face of his brother."
10217,ylt,"And Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, dieth, and she is buried at the lower part of Bethel, under the oak, and he calleth its name `Oak of weeping.'"
10218,ylt,"And God appeareth unto Jacob again, in his coming from Padan-Aram, and blesseth him;"
10219,ylt,"and God saith to him, `Thy name `is' Jacob: thy name is no more called Jacob, but Israel is thy name;' and He calleth his name Israel."
10220,ylt,"And God saith to him, `I `am' God Almighty; be fruitful and multiply, a nation and an assembly of nations is from thee, and kings from thy loins go out;"
10221,ylt,"and the land which I have given to Abraham and to Isaac -- to thee I give it, yea to thy seed after thee I give the land.'"
10222,ylt,"And God goeth up from him, in the place where He hath spoken with him."
10223,ylt,"And Jacob setteth up a standing pillar in the place where He hath spoken with him, a standing pillar of stone, and he poureth on it an oblation, and he poureth on it oil;"
10224,ylt,and Jacob calleth the name of the place where God spake with him Bethel.
10225,ylt,"And they journey from Bethel, and there is yet a kibrath of land before entering Ephratha, and Rachel beareth, and is sharply pained in her bearing;"
10226,ylt,"and it cometh to pass, in her being sharply pained in her bearing, that the midwife saith to her, `Fear not, for this also `is' a son for thee.'"
10227,ylt,"And it cometh to pass in the going out of her soul (for she died), that she calleth his name Ben-Oni; and his father called him Benjamin;"
10228,ylt,"and Rachel dieth, and is buried in the way to Ephratha, which `is' Bethlehem,"
10229,ylt,and Jacob setteth up a standing pillar over her grave; which `is' the standing pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.
10230,ylt,"And Israel journeyeth, and stretcheth out his tent beyond the tower of Edar;"
10231,ylt,"and it cometh to pass in Israel's dwelling in that land, that Reuben goeth, and lieth with Bilhah his father's concubine; and Israel heareth."
10232,ylt,"And the sons of Jacob are twelve. Sons of Leah: Jacob's first-born Reuben, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun."
10233,ylt,Sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
10234,ylt,"And sons of Bilhah, Rachel's maid-servant: Dan and Naphtali."
10235,ylt,"And sons of Zilpah, Leah's maid-servant: Gad and Asher. These `are' sons of Jacob, who have been born to him in Padan-Aram."
10236,ylt,"And Jacob cometh unto Isaac his father, at Mamre, the city of Arba (which `is' Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac have sojourned."
10237,ylt,"And the days of Isaac are a hundred and eighty years,"
10238,ylt,"and Isaac expireth, and dieth, and is gathered unto his people, aged and satisfied with days; and bury him do Esau and Jacob his sons."
10239,ylt,"And these `are' births of Esau, who `is' Edom."
10240,ylt,"Esau hath taken his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah daughter of Anah, daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,"
10241,ylt,"and Bashemath daughter of Ishmael, sister of Nebajoth."
10242,ylt,"And Adah beareth to Esau, Eliphaz; and Bashemath hath born Reuel;"
10243,ylt,"and Aholibamah hath born Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah. These `are' sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan."
10244,ylt,"And Esau taketh his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance which he hath acquired in the land of Canaan, and goeth into the country from the face of Jacob his brother;"
10245,ylt,"for their substance was more abundant than to dwell together, and the land of their sojournings was not able to bear them because of their cattle;"
10246,ylt,and Esau dwelleth in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.
10247,ylt,"And these `are' births of Esau, father of Edom, in mount Seir."

10294,ylt,"and Israel saith unto Joseph, `Are not thy brethren feeding in Shechem? come, and I send thee unto them;' and he saith to him, `Here `am' I;'"
10295,ylt,"and he saith to him, `Go, I pray thee, see the peace of thy brethren, and the peace of the flock, and bring me back word;' and he sendeth him from the valley of Hebron, and he cometh to Shechem."
10296,ylt,"And a man findeth him, and lo, he is wandering in the field, and the man asketh him, saying, `What seekest thou?'"
10297,ylt,"and he saith, `My brethren I am seeking, declare to me, I pray thee, where they are feeding?'"
10298,ylt,"And the man saith, `They have journeyed from this, for I have heard some saying, Let us go to Dothan,' and Joseph goeth after his brethren, and findeth them in Dothan."
10299,ylt,"And they see him from afar, even before he draweth near unto them, and they conspire against him to put him to death."
10300,ylt,"And they say one unto another, `Lo, this man of the dreams cometh;"
10301,ylt,"and now, come, and we slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and have said, An evil beast hath devoured him; and we see what his dreams are.'"
10302,ylt,"And Reuben heareth, and delivereth him out of their hand, and saith, `Let us not smite the life;'"
10303,ylt,"and Reuben saith unto them, `Shed no blood; cast him into this pit which `is' in the wilderness, and put not forth a hand upon him,' -- in order to deliver him out of their hand, to bring him back unto his father."
10304,ylt,"And it cometh to pass, when Joseph hath come unto his brethren, that they strip Joseph of his coat, the long coat which `is' upon him,"
10305,ylt,"and take him and cast him into the pit, and the pit `is' empty, there is no water in it."
10306,ylt,"And they sit down to eat bread, and they lift up their eyes, and look, and lo, a company of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, and their camels bearing spices, and balm, and myrrh, going to take `them' down to Egypt."
10307,ylt,"And Judah saith unto his brethren, `What gain when we slay our brother, and have concealed his blood?"
10308,ylt,"Come, and we sell him to the Ishmaelites, and our hands are not on him, for he `is' our brother -- our flesh;' and his brethren hearken."
10309,ylt,"And Midianite merchantmen pass by and they draw out and bring up Joseph out of the pit, and sell Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty silverlings, and they bring Joseph into Egypt."
10310,ylt,"And Reuben returneth unto the pit, and lo, Joseph is not in the pit, and he rendeth his garments,"
10311,ylt,"and he returneth unto his brethren, and saith, `The lad is not, and I -- whither am I going?'"
10312,ylt,"And they take the coat of Joseph, and slaughter a kid of the goats, and dip the coat in the blood,"
10313,ylt,"and send the long coat, and they bring `it' in unto their father, and say, `This have we found; discern, we pray thee, whether it `is' thy son's coat or not?'"
10314,ylt,"And he discerneth it, and saith, `My son's coat! an evil beast hath devoured him; torn -- torn is Joseph!'"
10315,ylt,"And Jacob rendeth his raiment, and putteth sackcloth on his loins, and becometh a mourner for his son many days,"
10316,ylt,"and all his sons and all his daughters rise to comfort him, and he refuseth to comfort himself, and saith, `For -- I go down mourning unto my son, to Sheol,' and his father weepeth for him."
10317,ylt,"And the Medanites have sold him unto Egypt, to Potiphar, a eunuch of Pharaoh, head of the executioners."
10318,ylt,"And it cometh to pass, at that time, that Judah goeth down from his brethren, and turneth aside unto a man, an Adullamite, whose name `is' Hirah;"
10319,ylt,"and Judah seeth there the daughter of a man, a Canaanite, whose name `is' Shuah, and taketh her, and goeth in unto her."
10320,ylt,"And she conceiveth, and beareth a son, and he calleth his name Er;"
10321,ylt,"and she conceiveth again, and beareth a son, and calleth his name Onan;"
10322,ylt,"and she addeth again, and beareth a son, and calleth his name Shelah; and he was in Chezib in her bearing him."
10323,ylt,"And Judah taketh a wife for Er, his first-born, and her name `is' Tamar;"
10324,ylt,"and Er, Judah's first-born, is evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and Jehovah doth put him to death."
10325,ylt,"And Judah saith to Onan, `Go in unto the wife of thy brother, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother;'"
10326,ylt,"and Onan knoweth that the seed is not `reckoned' his; and it hath come to pass, if he hath gone in unto his brother's wife, that he hath destroyed `it' to the earth, so as not to give seed to his brother;"
10327,ylt,"and that which he hath done is evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and He putteth him also to death."
10328,ylt,"And Judah saith to Tamar his daughter-in-law, `Abide a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son groweth up;' for he said, `Lest he die -- even he -- like his brethren;' and Tamar goeth and dwelleth at her father's house."
10329,ylt,"And the days are multiplied, and the daughter of Shuah, Judah's wife, dieth; and Judah is comforted, and goeth up unto his sheep-shearers, he and Hirah his friend the Adullamite, to Timnath."
10330,ylt,"And it is declared to Tamar, saying, `Lo, thy husband's father is going up to Timnath to shear his flock;'"
10331,ylt,"and she turneth aside the garments of her widowhood from off her, and covereth herself with a vail, and wrappeth herself up, and sitteth in the opening of Enayim, which `is' by the way to Timnath, for she hath seen that Shelah hath grown up, and she hath not been given to him for a wife."
10332,ylt,"And Judah seeth her, and reckoneth her for a harlot, for she hath covered her face,"
10333,ylt,"and he turneth aside unto her by the way, and saith, `Come, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee,' (for he hath not known that she `is' his daughter-in-law); and she saith, `What dost thou give to me, that thou mayest come in unto me?'"
10334,ylt,"and he saith, `I -- I send a kid of the goats from the flock.' And she saith, `Dost thou give a pledge till thou send `it'?'"
10335,ylt,"and he saith, `What `is' the pledge that I give to thee?' and she saith, `Thy seal, and thy ribbon, and thy staff which `is' in thy hand;' and he giveth to her, and goeth in unto her, and she conceiveth to him;"
10336,ylt,"and she riseth, and goeth, and turneth aside her vail from off her, and putteth on the garments of her widowhood."
10337,ylt,"And Judah sendeth the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the hand of the woman, and he hath not found her."
10338,ylt,"And he asketh the men of her place, saying, `Where `is' the separated one -- she in Enayim, by the way?' and they say, `There hath not been in this `place' a separated one.'"
10339,ylt,"And he turneth back unto Judah, and saith, `I have not found her; and the men of the place also have said, There hath not been in this `place' a separated one,'"
10340,ylt,"and Judah saith, `Let her take to herself, lest we become despised; lo, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.'"
10341,ylt,"And it cometh to pass about three months `after', that it is declared to Judah, saying, `Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath committed fornication; and also, lo, she hath conceived by fornication:' and Judah saith, `Bring her out -- and she is burnt.'"
10342,ylt,"She is brought out, and she hath sent unto her husband's father, saying, `To a man whose these `are', I `am' pregnant;' and she saith, `Discern, I pray thee, whose `are' these -- the seal, and the ribbons, and the staff.'"
10343,ylt,"And Judah discerneth and saith, `She hath been more righteous than I, because that I did not give her to Shelah my son;' and he hath not added to know her again."
10344,ylt,"And it cometh to pass in the time of her bearing, that lo, twins `are' in her womb;"
10345,ylt,"and it cometh to pass in her bearing, that `one' giveth out a hand, and the midwife taketh and bindeth on his hand a scarlet thread, saying, `This hath come out first.'"
10346,ylt,"And it cometh to pass as he draweth back his hand, that lo, his brother hath come out, and she saith, `What! thou hast broken forth -- on thee `is' the breach;' and he calleth his name Pharez;"
10347,ylt,"and afterwards hath his brother come out, on whose hand `is' the scarlet thread, and he calleth his name Zarah."
10348,ylt,"And Joseph hath been brought down to Egypt, and Potiphar, a eunuch of Pharaoh, head of the executioners, an Egyptian man, buyeth him out of the hands of the Ishmaelites who have brought him thither."
10349,ylt,"And Jehovah is with Joseph, and he is a prosperous man, and he is in the house of his lord the Egyptian,"
10350,ylt,"and his lord seeth that Jehovah is with him, and all that he is doing Jehovah is causing to prosper in his hand,"
10351,ylt,"and Joseph findeth grace in his eyes and serveth him, and he appointeth him over his house, and all that he hath he hath given into his hand."
10352,ylt,"And it cometh to pass from the time that he hath appointed him over his house, and over all that he hath, that Jehovah blesseth the house of the Egyptian for Joseph's sake, and the blessing of Jehovah is on all that he hath, in the house, and in the field;"
10353,ylt,"and he leaveth all that he hath in the hand of Joseph, and he hath not known anything that he hath, except the bread which he is eating. And Joseph is of a fair form, and of a fair appearance."
10354,ylt,"And it cometh to pass after these things, that his lord's wife lifteth up her eyes unto Joseph, and saith, `Lie with me;'"
10355,ylt,"and he refuseth, and saith unto his lord's wife, `Lo, my lord hath not known what `is' with me in the house, and all that he hath he hath given into my hand;"
10356,ylt,"none is greater in this house than I, and he hath not withheld from me anything, except thee, because thou `art' his wife; and how shall I do this great evil? -- then have I sinned against God.'"
10357,ylt,"And it cometh to pass at her speaking unto Joseph day `by' day, that he hath not hearkened unto her, to lie near her, to be with her;"
10358,ylt,"and it cometh to pass about this day, that he goeth into the house to do his work, and there is none of the men of the house there in the house,"
10359,ylt,"and she catcheth him by his garment, saying, `Lie with me;' and he leaveth his garment in her hand, and fleeth, and goeth without."
10360,ylt,"And it cometh to pass when she seeth that he hath left his garment in her hand, and fleeth without,"
10361,ylt,"that she calleth for the men of her house, and speaketh to them, saying, `See, he hath brought in to us a man, a Hebrew, to play with us; he hath come in unto me, to lie with me, and I call with a loud voice,"
10362,ylt,"and it cometh to pass, when he heareth that I have lifted up my voice and call, that he leaveth his garment near me, and fleeth, and goeth without.'"
10363,ylt,"And she placeth his garment near her, until the coming in of his lord unto his house."
10364,ylt,"And she speaketh unto him according to these words, saying, `The Hebrew servant whom thou hast brought unto us, hath come in unto me to play with me;"
10365,ylt,"and it cometh to pass, when I lift my voice and call, that he leaveth his garment near me, and fleeth without.'"
10366,ylt,"And it cometh to pass when his lord heareth the words of his wife, which she hath spoken unto him, saying, `According to these things hath thy servant done to me,' that his anger burneth;"
10367,ylt,"and Joseph's lord taketh him, and putteth him unto the round-house, a place where the king's prisoners `are' bound; and he is there in the round-house."
10368,ylt,"And Jehovah is with Joseph, and stretcheth out kindness unto him, and putteth his grace in the eyes of the chief of the round-house;"
10369,ylt,"and the chief of the round-house giveth into the hand of Joseph all the prisoners who `are' in the round-house, and of all that they are doing there, he hath been doer;"
10370,ylt,"the chief of the round-house seeth not anything under his hand, because Jehovah `is' with him, and that which he is doing Jehovah is causing to prosper."
10371,ylt,"And it cometh to pass, after these things -- the butler of the king of Egypt and the baker have sinned against their lord, against the king of Egypt;"
10372,ylt,"and Pharaoh is wroth against his two eunuchs, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers,"
10373,ylt,"and giveth them in charge in the house of the chief of the executioners, unto the round-house, the place where Joseph `is' a prisoner,"
10374,ylt,"and the chief of the executioners chargeth Joseph with them, and he serveth them; and they are days in charge."
10375,ylt,"And they dream a dream both of them, each his dream in one night, each according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker whom the king of Egypt hath, who `are' prisoners in the round-house."
10376,ylt,"And Joseph cometh in unto them in the morning, and seeth them, and lo, they `are' morose;"
10377,ylt,"and he asketh Pharaoh's eunuchs who `are' with him in charge in the house of his lord, saying, `Wherefore `are' your faces sad to-day?'"
10378,ylt,"And they say unto him, `A dream we have dreamed, and there is no interpreter of it;' and Joseph saith unto them, `Are not interpretations with God? recount, I pray you, to me.'"
10379,ylt,"And the chief of the butlers recounteth his dream to Joseph, and saith to him, `In my dream, then lo, a vine `is' before me!"
10380,ylt,"and in the vine `are' three branches, and it `is' as it were flourishing; gone up hath its blossom, its clusters have ripened grapes;"
10381,ylt,"and Pharaoh's cup `is' in my hand, and I take the grapes and press them into the cup of Pharaoh, and I give the cup into the hand of Pharaoh.'"
10382,ylt,"And Joseph saith to him, `This `is' its interpretation: the three branches are three days;"
10383,ylt,"yet, within three days doth Pharaoh lift up thy head, and hath put thee back on thy station, and thou hast given the cup of Pharaoh into his hand, according to the former custom when thou wast his butler."
10384,ylt,"`Surely if thou hast remembered me with thee, when it is well with thee, and hast done (I pray thee) kindness with me, and hast made mention of me unto Pharaoh, then hast thou brought me out from this house,"
10385,ylt,for I was really stolen from the land of the Hebrews; and here also have I done nothing that they have put me in the pit.'
10386,ylt,"And the chief of the bakers seeth that he hath interpreted good, and he saith unto Joseph, `I also `am' in a dream, and lo, three baskets of white bread `are' on my head,"
10387,ylt,"and in the uppermost basket `are' of all `kinds' of Pharaoh's food, work of a baker; and the birds are eating them out of the basket, from off my head.'"
10388,ylt,"And Joseph answereth and saith, `This `is' its interpretation: the three baskets are three days;"
10389,ylt,"yet, within three days doth Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and hath hanged thee on a tree, and the birds have eaten thy flesh from off thee.'"
10390,ylt,"And it cometh to pass, on the third day, Pharaoh's birthday, that he maketh a banquet to all his servants, and lifteth up the head of the chief of the butlers, and the head of the chief of the bakers among his servants,"
10391,ylt,"and he putteth back the chief of the butlers to his butlership, and he giveth the cup into the hand of Pharaoh;"
10392,ylt,"and the chief of the bakers he hath hanged, as Joseph hath interpreted to them;"
10393,ylt,"and the chief of the butlers hath not remembered Joseph, but forgetteth him."
10394,ylt,"And it cometh to pass, at the end of two years of days that Pharaoh is dreaming, and lo, he is standing by the River,"
10395,ylt,"and lo, from the River coming up are seven kine, of fair appearance, and fat `in' flesh, and they feed among the reeds;"
10396,ylt,"and lo, seven other kine are coming up after them out of the River, of bad appearance, and lean `in' flesh, and they stand near the kine on the edge of the River,"
10397,ylt,"and the kine of bad appearance and lean `in' flesh eat up the seven kine of fair appearance, and fat -- and Pharaoh awaketh."
10398,ylt,"And he sleepeth, and dreameth a second time, and lo, seven ears are coming up on one stalk, fat and good,"
10399,ylt,"and lo, seven ears, thin, and blasted with an east wind, are springing up after them;"
10400,ylt,"and the thin ears swallow the seven fat and full ears -- and Pharaoh awaketh, and lo, a dream."
10401,ylt,"And it cometh to pass in the morning, that his spirit is moved, and he sendeth and calleth all the scribes of Egypt, and all its wise men, and Pharaoh recounteth to them his dream, and there is no interpreter of them to Pharaoh."
10402,ylt,"And the chief of the butlers speaketh with Pharaoh, saying, `My sin I mention this day:"
10403,ylt,"Pharaoh hath been wroth against his servants, and giveth me into charge in the house of the chief of the executioners, me and the chief of the bakers;"
10404,ylt,"and we dream a dream in one night, I and he, each according to the interpretation of his dream we have dreamed."
10405,ylt,"And there `is' with us a youth, a Hebrew, servant to the chief of the executioners, and we recount to him, and he interpreteth to us our dreams, `to' each according to his dream hath he interpreted,"
10406,ylt,"and it cometh to pass, as he hath interpreted to us so it hath been, me he put back on my station, and him he hanged.'"
10407,ylt,"And Pharaoh sendeth and calleth Joseph, and they cause him to run out of the pit, and he shaveth, and changeth his garments, and cometh in unto Pharaoh."
10408,ylt,"And Pharaoh saith unto Joseph, `A dream I have dreamed, and there is no interpreter of it, and I -- I have heard concerning thee, saying, Thou understandest a dream to interpret it,'"
10409,ylt,"and Joseph answereth Pharaoh, saying, `Without me -- God doth answer Pharaoh with peace.'"
10410,ylt,"And Pharaoh speaketh unto Joseph: `In my dream, lo, I am standing by the edge of the River,"
10411,ylt,"and lo, out of the River coming up are seven kine, fat `in' flesh, and of fair form, and they feed among the reeds;"
10412,ylt,"and lo, seven other kine are coming up after them, thin, and of very bad form, and lean `in' flesh; I have not seen like these in all the land of Egypt for badness."
10413,ylt,"`And the lean and the bad kine eat up the first seven fat kine,"
10414,ylt,"and they come in unto their midst, and it hath not been known that they have come in unto their midst, and their appearance `is' bad as at the commencement; and I awake."
10415,ylt,"`And I see in my dream, and lo, seven ears are coming up on one stalk, full and good;"
10416,ylt,"and lo, seven ears, withered, thin, blasted with an east wind, are springing up after them;"
10417,ylt,"and the thin ears swallow the seven good ears; and I tell unto the scribes, and there is none declaring to me.'"
10418,ylt,"And Joseph saith unto Pharaoh, `The dream of Pharaoh is one: that which God is doing he hath declared to Pharaoh;"
10419,ylt,"the seven good kine are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years, the dream is one;"
10420,ylt,"and the seven thin and bad kine which are coming up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears, blasted with an east wind, are seven years of famine;"
10421,ylt,"this `is' the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: That which God is doing, he hath shewn Pharaoh."
10422,ylt,"`Lo, seven years are coming of great abundance in all the land of Egypt,"
10423,ylt,"and seven years of famine have arisen after them, and all the plenty is forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine hath finished the land,"
10424,ylt,"and the plenty is not known in the land because of that famine afterwards, for it `is' very grievous."
10425,ylt,"`And because of the repeating of the dream unto Pharaoh twice, surely the thing is established by God, and God is hastening to do it."
10426,ylt,"`And now, let Pharaoh provide a man, intelligent and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt;"
10427,ylt,"let Pharaoh make and appoint overseers over the land, and receive a fifth of the land of Egypt in the seven years of plenty,"
10428,ylt,"and they gather all the food of these good years that are coming, and heap up corn under the hand of Pharaoh -- food in the cities; and they have kept `it',"
10429,ylt,"and the food hath been for a store for the land, for the seven years of famine which are in the land of Egypt; and the land is cut off by the famine.'"
10430,ylt,"And the thing is good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants,"
10431,ylt,"and Pharaoh saith unto his servants, `Do we find like this, a man in whom the spirit of God `is'?'"
10432,ylt,"and Pharaoh saith unto Joseph, `After God's causing thee to know all this, there is none intelligent and wise as thou;"
10433,ylt,"thou -- thou art over my house, and at thy mouth do all my people kiss; only in the throne I am greater than thou.'"
10434,ylt,"And Pharaoh saith unto Joseph, `See, I have put thee over all the land of Egypt.'"
10435,ylt,"And Pharaoh turneth aside his seal-ring from off his hand, and putteth it on the hand of Joseph, and clotheth him `with' garments of fine linen, and placeth a chain of gold on his neck,"
10436,ylt,"and causeth him to ride in the second chariot which he hath, and they proclaim before him, `Bow the knee!' and -- to put him over all the land of Egypt."
10437,ylt,"And Pharaoh saith unto Joseph, `I `am' Pharaoh, and without thee a man doth not lift up his hand and his foot in all the land of Egypt;'"
10438,ylt,"and Pharaoh calleth Joseph's name Zaphnath-Paaneah, and he giveth to him Asenath daughter of Poti-Pherah, priest of On, for a wife, and Joseph goeth out over the land of Egypt."
10439,ylt,"And Joseph `is' a son of thirty years in his standing before Pharaoh king of Egypt, and Joseph goeth out from the presence of Pharaoh, and passeth over through all the land of Egypt;"
10440,ylt,and the land maketh in the seven years of plenty by handfuls.
10441,ylt,"And he gathereth all the food of the seven years which have been in the land of Egypt, and putteth food in the cities; the food of the field which `is' round about `each' city hath he put in its midst;"
10442,ylt,"and Joseph gathereth corn as sand of the sea, multiplying exceedingly, until that he hath ceased to number, for there is no number."
10443,ylt,"And to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine cometh, whom Asenath daughter of Poti-Pherah, priest of On, hath borne to him,"
10444,ylt,"and Joseph calleth the name of the first-born Manasseh: `for, God hath made me to forget all my labour, and all the house of my father;'"
10445,ylt,"and the name of the second he hath called Ephraim: `for, God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of mine affliction.'"
10446,ylt,"And the seven years of plenty are completed which have been in the land of Egypt,"
10447,ylt,"and the seven years of famine begin to come, as Joseph said, and famine is in all the lands, but in all the land of Egypt hath been bread;"
10448,ylt,"and all the land of Egypt is famished, and the people crieth unto Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh saith to all the Egyptians, `Go unto Joseph; that which he saith to you -- do.'"
10449,ylt,"And the famine has been over all the face of the land, and Joseph openeth all `places' which have `corn' in them, and selleth to the Egyptians; and the famine is severe in the land of Egypt,"
10450,ylt,"and all the earth hath come to Egypt, to buy, unto Joseph, for the famine was severe in all the earth."
10451,ylt,"And Jacob seeth that there is corn in Egypt, and Jacob saith to his sons, `Why do you look at each other?'"
10452,ylt,"he saith also, `Lo, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt, go down thither, and buy for us from thence, and we live and do not die;'"
10453,ylt,"and the ten brethren of Joseph go down to buy corn in Egypt,"
10454,ylt,"and Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob hath not sent with his brethren, for he said, `Lest mischief meet him.'"
10455,ylt,"And the sons of Israel come to buy in the midst of those coming, for the famine hath been in the land of Canaan,"
10456,ylt,"and Joseph is the ruler over the land, he who is selling to all the people of the land, and Joseph's brethren come and bow themselves to him -- face to the earth."
10457,ylt,"And Joseph seeth his brethren, and discerneth them, and maketh himself strange unto them, and speaketh with them sharp things, and saith unto them, `From whence have ye come?' and they say, `From the land of Canaan -- to buy food.'"
10458,ylt,"And Joseph discerneth his brethren, but they have not discerned him,"
10459,ylt,"and Joseph remembereth the dreams which he dreamed of them, and saith unto them, `Ye `are' spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye have come.'"
10460,ylt,"And they say unto him, `No, my lord, but thy servants have come to buy food;"
10461,ylt,"we `are' all of us sons of one man, we `are' right men; thy servants have not been spies;'"
10462,ylt,"and he saith unto them, `No, but the nakedness of the land ye have come to see;'"
10463,ylt,"and they say, `Thy servants `are' twelve brethren; we `are' sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and lo, the young one `is' with our father to-day, and the one is not.'"
10464,ylt,"And Joseph saith unto them, `This `is' that which I have spoken unto you, saying, Ye `are' spies,"
10465,ylt,by this ye are proved: Pharaoh liveth! if ye go out from this -- except by your young brother coming hither;
10466,ylt,"send one of you, and let him bring your brother, and ye, remain ye bound, and let your words be proved, whether truth be with you: and if not -- Pharaoh liveth! surely ye `are' spies;'"
10467,ylt,and he removeth them unto charge three days.
10468,ylt,"And Joseph saith unto them on the third day, `This do and live; God I fear!"
10469,ylt,"if ye `are' right men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your ward, and ye, go, carry in corn `for' the famine of your houses,"
10470,ylt,"and your young brother ye bring unto me, and your words are established, and ye die not;' and they do so."
10471,ylt,"And they say one unto another, `Verily we `are' guilty concerning our brother, because we saw the distress of his soul, in his making supplication unto us, and we did not hearken: therefore hath this distress come upon us.'"
10472,ylt,"And Reuben answereth them, saying, `Spake I not unto you, saying, Sin not against the lad? and ye hearkened not; and his blood also, lo, it is required.'"
10473,ylt,"And they have not known that Joseph understandeth, for the interpreter `is' between them;"
10474,ylt,"and he turneth round from them, and weepeth, and turneth back unto them, and speaketh unto them, and taketh from them Simeon, and bindeth him before their eyes."
10475,ylt,"And Joseph commandeth, and they fill their vessels `with' corn, also to put back the money of each unto his sack, and to give to them provision for the way; and one doth to them so."
10476,ylt,"And they lift up their corn upon their asses, and go from thence,"
10477,ylt,"and the one openeth his sack to give provender to his ass at a lodging-place, and he seeth his money, and lo, it `is' in the mouth of his bag,"
10478,ylt,"and he saith unto his brethren, `My money hath been put back, and also, lo, in my bag:' and their heart goeth out, and they tremble, one to another saying, `What `is' this God hath done to us!'"
10479,ylt,"And they come in unto Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and they declare to him all the things meeting them, saying,"
10480,ylt,"`The man, the lord of the land, hath spoken with us sharp things, and maketh us as spies of the land;"
10481,ylt,"and we say unto him, We `are' right men, we have not been spies,"
10482,ylt,"we `are' twelve brethren, sons of our father, the one is not, and the young one `is' to-day with our father in the land of Canaan."
10483,ylt,"`And the man, the lord of the land, saith unto us, By this I know that ye `are' right men -- one of your brethren leave with me, and `for' the famine of your houses take ye and go,"
10484,ylt,"and bring your young brother unto me, and I know that ye `are' not spies, but ye `are' right men; your brother I give to you, and ye trade with the land.'"
10485,ylt,"And it cometh to pass, they are emptying their sacks, and lo, the bundle of each man's silver `is' in his sack, and they see their bundles of silver, they and their father, and are afraid;"
10486,ylt,"and Jacob their father saith unto them, `Me ye have bereaved; Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and Benjamin ye take -- against me have been all these.'"
10487,ylt,"And Reuben speaketh unto his father, saying, `My two sons thou dost put to death, if I bring him not in unto thee; give him into my hand, and I -- I bring him back unto thee;'"
10488,ylt,"and he saith, `My son doth not go down with you, for his brother `is' dead, and he by himself is left; when mischief hath met him in the way in which ye go, then ye have brought down my grey hairs in sorrow to sheol.'"
10489,ylt,And the famine `is' severe in the land;
10490,ylt,"and it cometh to pass, when they have finished eating the corn which they brought from Egypt, that their father saith unto them, `Turn back, buy for us a little food.'"
10491,ylt,"And Judah speaketh unto him, saying, `The man protesting protested to us, saying, Ye do not see my face without your brother `being' with you;"
10492,ylt,"if thou art sending our brother with us, we go down, and buy for thee food,"
10493,ylt,"and if thou art not sending -- we do not go down, for the man said unto us, Ye do not see my face without your brother `being' with you.'"
10494,ylt,"And Israel saith, `Why did ye evil to me, by declaring to the man that ye had yet a brother?'"
10495,ylt,"and they say, `The man asked diligently concerning us, and concerning our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye a brother? and we declare to him according to the tenor of these things; do we certainly know that he will say, Bring down your brother?'"
10496,ylt,"And Judah saith unto Israel his father, `Send the youth with me, and we arise, and go, and live, and do not die, both we, and thou, and our infants."
10497,ylt,"I -- I am surety `for' him, from my hand thou dost require him; if I have not brought him in unto thee, and set him before thee -- then I have sinned against thee all the days;"
10498,ylt,"for if we had not lingered, surely now we had returned these two times.'"
10499,ylt,"And Israel their father saith unto them, `If so, now, this do: take of the praised thing of the land in your vessels, and take down to the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts and almonds;"
10500,ylt,"and double money take in your hand, even the money which is brought back in the mouth of your bags, ye take back in your hand, it may be it `is' an oversight."
10501,ylt,"`And take your brother, and rise, turn back unto the man;"
10502,ylt,"and God Almighty give to you mercies before the man, so that he hath sent to you your other brother and Benjamin; and I, when I am bereaved -- I am bereaved.'"
10503,ylt,"And the men take this present, double money also they have taken in their hand, and Benjamin; and they rise, and go down to Egypt, and stand before Joseph;"
10504,ylt,"and Joseph seeth Benjamin with them, and saith to him who `is' over his house, `Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal, and make ready, for with me do the men eat at noon.'"
10505,ylt,"And the man doth as Joseph hath said, and the man bringeth in the men into the house of Joseph,"
10506,ylt,"and the men are afraid because they have been brought into the house of Joseph, and they say, `For the matter of the money which was put back in our bags at the commencement are we brought in -- to roll himself upon us, and to throw himself on us, and to take us for servants -- our asses also.'"
10507,ylt,"And they come nigh unto the man who `is' over the house of Joseph, and speak unto him at the opening of the house,"
10508,ylt,"and say, `O, my lord, we really come down at the commencement to buy food;"
10509,ylt,"and it cometh to pass, when we have come in unto the lodging-place, and open our bags, that lo, each one's money `is' in the mouth of his bag, our money in its weight, and we bring it back in our hand;"
10510,ylt,and other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food; we have not known who put our money in our bags.'
10511,ylt,"And he saith, `Peace to you, fear not: your God and the God of your father hath given to you hidden treasure in your bags, your money came unto me;' and he bringeth out Simeon unto them."
10512,ylt,"And the man bringeth in the men into Joseph's house, and giveth water, and they wash their feet; and he giveth provender for their asses,"
10513,ylt,"and they prepare the present until the coming of Joseph at noon, for they have heard that there they do eat bread."
10514,ylt,"And Joseph cometh into the house, and they bring to him the present which `is' in their hand, into the house, and bow themselves to him, to the earth;"
10515,ylt,"and he asketh of them of peace, and saith, `Is your father well? the aged man of whom ye have spoken, is he yet alive?'"
10516,ylt,"and they say, `Thy servant our father `is' well, he is yet alive;' and they bow, and do obeisance."
10517,ylt,"And he lifteth up his eyes, and seeth Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and saith, `Is this your young brother, of whom ye have spoken unto me?' and he saith, `God favour thee, my son.'"
10518,ylt,"And Joseph hasteth, for his bowels have been moved for his brother, and he seeketh to weep, and entereth the inner chamber, and weepeth there;"
10519,ylt,"and he washeth his face, and goeth out, and refraineth himself, and saith, `Place bread.'"
10520,ylt,"And they place for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who are eating with him by themselves: for the Egyptians are unable to eat bread with the Hebrews, for it `is' an abomination to the Egyptians."
10521,ylt,"And they sit before him, the first-born according to his birthright, and the young one according to his youth, and the men wonder one at another;"
10522,ylt,"and he lifteth up gifts from before him unto them, and the gift of Benjamin is five hands more than the gifts of all of them; and they drink, yea, they drink abundantly with him."
10523,ylt,"And he commandeth him who `is' over his house, saying, `Fill the bags of the men `with' food, as they are able to bear, and put the money of each in the mouth of his bag;"
10524,ylt,"and my cup, the silver cup, thou dost put in the mouth of the bag of the young one, and his corn-money;' and he doth according to the word of Joseph which he hath spoken."
10525,ylt,"The morning is bright, and the men have been sent away, they and their asses --"
10526,ylt,"they have gone out of the city -- they have not gone far off -- and Joseph hath said to him who `is' over his house, `Rise, pursue after the men; and thou hast overtaken them, and thou hast said unto them, Why have ye recompensed evil for good?"
10527,ylt,Is not this that with which my lord drinketh? and he observeth diligently with it; ye have done evil `in' that which ye have done.'
10528,ylt,"And he overtaketh them, and speaketh unto them these words,"
10529,ylt,"and they say unto him, `Why doth my lord speak according to these words? far be it from thy servants to do according to this word;"
10530,ylt,"lo, the money which we found in the mouth of our bags we brought back unto thee from the land of Canaan, and how do we steal from the house of thy lord silver or gold?"
10531,ylt,"with whomsoever of thy servants it is found, he hath died, and we also are to my lord for servants.'"
10532,ylt,"And he saith, `Now, also, according to your words, so it `is'; he with whom it is found becometh my servant, and ye are acquitted;'"
10533,ylt,"and they hasten and take down each his bag to the earth, and each openeth his bag;"
10534,ylt,"and he searcheth -- at the eldest he hath begun, and at the youngest he hath completed -- and the cup is found in the bag of Benjamin;"
10535,ylt,"and they rend their garments, and each ladeth his ass, and they turn back to the city."
10536,ylt,"And Judah -- his brethren also -- cometh in unto the house of Joseph, and he is yet there, and they fall before him to the earth;"
10537,ylt,"and Joseph saith to them, `What `is' this deed that ye have done? have ye not known that a man like me doth diligently observe?'"
10538,ylt,"And Judah saith, `What do we say to my lord? what do we speak? and what -- do we justify ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants; lo, we `are' servants to my lord, both we, and he in whose hand the cup hath been found;'"
10539,ylt,"and he saith, `Far be it from me to do this; the man in whose hand the cup hath been found, he becometh my servant; and ye, go ye up in peace unto your father.'"
10540,ylt,"And Judah cometh nigh unto him, and saith, `O, my lord, let thy servant speak, I pray thee, a word in the ears of my lord, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant -- for thou art as Pharaoh."
10541,ylt,"My lord hath asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father or brother?"
10542,ylt,"and we say unto my lord, We have a father, an aged one, and a child of old age, a little one; and his brother died, and he is left alone of his mother, and his father hath loved him."
10543,ylt,"`And thou sayest unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, and I set mine eye upon him;"
10544,ylt,"and we say unto my lord, The youth is not able to leave his father, when he hath left his father, then he hath died;"
10545,ylt,"and thou sayest unto thy servants, If your young brother come not down with you, ye add not to see my face."
10546,ylt,"`And it cometh to pass, that we have come up unto thy servant my father, that we declare to him the words of my lord;"
10547,ylt,"and our father saith, Turn back, buy for us a little food,"
10548,ylt,"and we say, We are not able to go down; if our young brother is with us, then we have gone down; for we are not able to see the man's face, and our young brother not with us."
10549,ylt,"`And thy servant my father saith unto us, Ye -- ye have known that two did my wife bare to me,"
10550,ylt,"and the one goeth out from me, and I say, Surely he is torn -- torn! and I have not seen him since;"
10551,ylt,"when ye have taken also this from my presence, and mischief hath met him, then ye have brought down my grey hairs with evil to sheol."
10552,ylt,"`And now, at my coming in unto thy servant my father, and the youth not with us (and his soul is bound up in his soul),"
10553,ylt,"then it hath come to pass when he seeth that the youth is not, that he hath died, and thy servants have brought down the grey hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to sheol;"
10554,ylt,"for thy servant obtained the youth by surety from my father, saying, If I bring him not in unto thee -- then I have sinned against my father all the days."
10555,ylt,"`And now, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the youth a servant to my lord, and the youth goeth up with his brethren,"
10556,ylt,"for how do I go up unto my father, and the youth not with me? lest I look on the evil which doth find my father.'"
10557,ylt,"And Joseph hath not been able to refrain himself before all those standing by him, and he calleth, `Put out every man from me;' and no man hath stood with him when Joseph maketh himself known unto his brethren,"
10558,ylt,"and he giveth forth his voice in weeping, and the Egyptians hear, and the house of Pharaoh heareth."
10559,ylt,"And Joseph saith unto his brethren, `I `am' Joseph, is my father yet alive?' and his brethren have not been able to answer him, for they have been troubled at his presence."
10560,ylt,"And Joseph saith unto his brethren, `Come nigh unto me, I pray you,' and they come nigh; and he saith, `I `am' Joseph, your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt;"
10561,ylt,"and now, be not grieved, nor let it be displeasing in your eyes that ye sold me hither, for to preserve life hath God sent me before you."
10562,ylt,"`Because these two years the famine `is' in the heart of the land, and yet `are' five years, `in' which there is neither ploughing nor harvest;"
10563,ylt,"and God sendeth me before you, to place of you a remnant in the land, and to give life to you by a great escape;"
10564,ylt,"and now, ye -- ye have not sent me hither, but God, and He doth set me for a father to Pharaoh, and for lord to all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt."
10565,ylt,"`Haste, and go up unto my father, then ye have said to him, Thus said Joseph thy son, God hath set me for lord to all Egypt; come down unto me, stay not,"
10566,ylt,"and thou hast dwelt in the land of Goshen, and been near unto me, thou and thy sons, and thy son's sons, and thy flock, and thy herd, and all that thou hast,"
10567,ylt,"and I have nourished thee there -- for yet `are' five years of famine -- lest thou become poor, thou and thy household, and all that thou hast."
10568,ylt,"`And lo, your eyes are seeing, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that `it is' my mouth which is speaking unto you;"
10569,ylt,"and ye have declared to my father all my honour in Egypt, and all that ye have seen, and ye have hasted, and have brought down my father hither.'"
10570,ylt,"And he falleth on the neck of Benjamin his brother, and weepeth, and Benjamin hath wept on his neck;"
10571,ylt,"and he kisseth all his brethren, and weepeth over them; and afterwards have his brethren spoken with him."
10572,ylt,"And the sound hath been heard in the house of Pharaoh, saying, `Come have the brethren of Joseph;' and it is good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants,"
10573,ylt,"and Pharaoh saith unto Joseph, `Say unto thy brethren, This do ye: lade your beasts, and go, enter ye the land of Canaan,"
10574,ylt,"and take your father, and your households, and come unto me, and I give to you the good of the land of Egypt, and eat ye the fat of the land."
10575,ylt,"`Yea, thou -- thou hast been commanded: this do ye, take for yourselves out of the land of Egypt, waggons for your infants, and for your wives, and ye have brought your father, and come;"
10576,ylt,"and your eye hath no pity on your vessels, for the good of all the land of Egypt `is' yours.'"
10577,ylt,"And the sons of Israel do so, and Joseph giveth waggons to them by the command of Pharaoh, and he giveth to them provision for the way;"
10578,ylt,"to all of them hath he given -- to each changes of garments, and to Benjamin he hath given three hundred silverlings, and five changes of garments;"
10579,ylt,"and to his father he hath sent thus: ten asses bearing of the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses bearing corn and bread, even food for his father for the way."
10580,ylt,"And he sendeth his brethren away, and they go; and he saith unto them, `Be not angry in the way.'"
10581,ylt,"And they go up out of Egypt, and come in to the land of Canaan, unto Jacob their father,"
10582,ylt,"and they declare to him, saying, `Joseph `is' yet alive,' and that he `is' ruler over all the land of Egypt; and his heart ceaseth, for he hath not given credence to them."
10583,ylt,"And they speak unto him all the words of Joseph, which he hath spoken unto them, and he seeth the waggons which Joseph hath sent to bear him away, and live doth the spirit of Jacob their father;"
10584,ylt,"and Israel saith, `Enough! Joseph my son `is' yet alive; I go and see him before I die.'"
10585,ylt,"And Israel journeyeth, and all that he hath, and cometh in to Beer-Sheba, and sacrificeth sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac;"
10586,ylt,"and God speaketh to Israel in visions of the night, and saith, `Jacob, Jacob;' and he saith, `Here `am' I.'"
10587,ylt,"And He saith, `I `am' God, God of thy father, be not afraid of going down to Egypt, for for a great nation I set thee there;"
10588,ylt,"I -- I go down with thee to Egypt, and I -- I also certainly bring thee up, and Joseph doth put his hand on thine eyes.'"
10589,ylt,"And Jacob riseth from Beer-Sheba, and the sons of Israel bear away Jacob their father, And their infants, and their wives, in the waggons which Pharaoh hath sent to bear him,"
10590,ylt,"and they take their cattle, and their goods which they have acquired in the land of Canaan, and come into Egypt -- Jacob, and all his seed with him,"
10591,ylt,"his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, yea, all his seed he brought with him into Egypt."
10592,ylt,"And these `are' the names of the sons of Israel who are coming into Egypt: Jacob and his sons, Jacob's first-born, Reuben."
10593,ylt,"And sons of Reuben: Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi."
10594,ylt,"And sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul son of the Canaanitess."
10595,ylt,"And sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
10596,ylt,"And sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah, (and Er and Onan die in the land of Canaan.) And sons of Pharez are Hezron and Hamul."
10597,ylt,"And sons of Issachar: Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron."
10598,ylt,"And sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel."
10599,ylt,"These `are' sons of Leah whom she bare to Jacob in Padan-Aram, and Dinah his daughter; all the persons of his sons and his daughters `are' thirty and three."
10600,ylt,"And sons of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli."
10601,ylt,"And sons of Asher: Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister. And sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel."
10602,ylt,"These `are' sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and she beareth these to Jacob -- sixteen persons."
10603,ylt,"Sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin."
10604,ylt,"And born to Joseph in the land of Egypt (whom Asenath daughter of Poti-Pherah, priest of On, hath borne to him) `are' Manasseh and Ephraim."
10605,ylt,"And sons of Benjamin: Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard."
10606,ylt,"These `are' sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob; all the persons `are' fourteen."
10607,ylt,And sons of Dan: Hushim.
10608,ylt,"And sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem."
10609,ylt,"These `are' sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter; and she beareth these to Jacob -- all the persons `are' seven."
10610,ylt,"All the persons who are coming to Jacob to Egypt, coming out of his thigh, apart from the wives of Jacob's sons, all the persons `are' sixty and six."
10611,ylt,And the sons of Joseph who have been born to him in Egypt `are' two persons. All the persons of the house of Jacob who are coming into Egypt `are' seventy.
10612,ylt,"And Judah he hath sent before him unto Joseph, to direct before him to Goshen, and they come into the land of Goshen;"
10613,ylt,"and Joseph harnesseth his chariot, and goeth up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and appeareth unto him, and falleth on his neck, and weepeth on his neck again;"
10614,ylt,"and Israel saith unto Joseph, `Let me die this time, after my seeing thy face, for thou `art' yet alive.'"
10615,ylt,"And Joseph saith unto his brethren, and unto the house of his father, `I go up, and declare to Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and the house of my father who `are' in the land of Canaan have come in unto me;"
10616,ylt,"and the men `are' feeders of a flock, for they have been men of cattle; and their flock, and their herd, and all that they have, they have brought.'"
10617,ylt,"`And it hath come to pass when Pharaoh calleth for you, and hath said, What `are' your works?"
10618,ylt,"that ye have said, Thy servants have been men of cattle from our youth, even until now, both we and our fathers, -- in order that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen, for the abomination of the Egyptians is every one feeding a flock.'"
10619,ylt,"And Joseph cometh, and declareth to Pharaoh, and saith, `My father, and my brethren, and their flock, and their herd, and all they have, have come from the land of Canaan, and lo, they `are' in the land of Goshen.'"
10620,ylt,"And out of his brethren he hath taken five men, and setteth them before Pharaoh;"
10621,ylt,"and Pharaoh saith unto his brethren, `What `are' your works?' and they say unto Pharaoh, `Thy servants `are' feeders of a flock, both we and our fathers;'"
10622,ylt,"and they say unto Pharaoh, `To sojourn in the land we have come, for there is no pasture for the flock which thy servants have, for grievous `is' the famine in the land of Canaan; and now, let thy servants, we pray thee, dwell in the land of Goshen.'"
10623,ylt,"And Pharaoh speaketh unto Joseph, saying, `Thy father and thy brethren have come unto thee:"
10624,ylt,"the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land cause thy father and thy brethren to dwell -- they dwell in the land of Goshen, and if thou hast known, and there are among them men of ability, then thou hast set them heads over the cattle I have.'"
10625,ylt,"And Joseph bringeth in Jacob his father, and causeth him to stand before Pharaoh; and Jacob blesseth Pharaoh."
10626,ylt,"And Pharaoh saith unto Jacob, `How many `are' the days of the years of thy life?'"
10627,ylt,"And Jacob saith unto Pharaoh, `The days of the years of my sojournings `are' an hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not reached the days of the years of the life of my fathers, in the days of their sojournings.'"
10628,ylt,"And Jacob blesseth Pharaoh, and goeth out from before Pharaoh."
10629,ylt,"And Joseph settleth his father and his brethren, and giveth to them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh commanded;"
10630,ylt,"and Joseph nourisheth his father, and his brethren, and all the house of his father `with' bread, according to the mouth of the infants."
10631,ylt,"And there is no bread in all the land, for the famine `is' very grievous, and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan are feeble because of the famine;"
10632,ylt,"and Joseph gathereth all the silver that is found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn that they are buying, and Joseph bringeth the silver into the house of Pharaoh."
10633,ylt,"And the silver is consumed out of the land of Egypt, and out of the land of Canaan, and all the Egyptians come in unto Joseph, saying, `Give to us bread -- why do we die before thee, though the money hath ceased?'"
10634,ylt,"and Joseph saith, `Give your cattle; and I give to you for your cattle, if the money hath ceased.'"

10636,ylt,"And that year is finished, and they come in unto him on the second year, and say to him, `We do not hide from my lord, that since the money hath been finished, and possession of the cattle `is' unto my lord, there hath not been left before my lord save our bodies, and our ground;"
10637,ylt,"why do we die before thine eyes, both we and our ground? buy us and our ground for bread, and we and our ground are servants to Pharaoh; and give seed, and we live, and die not, and the ground is not desolate.'"
10638,ylt,"And Joseph buyeth all the ground of Egypt for Pharaoh, for the Egyptians have sold each his field, for the famine hath been severe upon them, and the land becometh Pharaoh's;"
10639,ylt,as to the people he hath removed them to cities from the `one' end of the border of Egypt even unto its `other' end.
10640,ylt,"Only the ground of the priests he hath not bought, for the priests have a portion from Pharaoh, and they have eaten their portion which Pharaoh hath given to them, therefore they have not sold their ground."
10641,ylt,"And Joseph saith unto the people, `Lo, I have bought you to-day and your ground for Pharaoh; lo, seed for you, and ye have sown the ground,"
10642,ylt,"and it hath come to pass in the increases, that ye have given a fifth to Pharaoh, and four of the parts are for yourselves, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for those who `are' in your houses, and for food for your infants.'"
10643,ylt,"And they say, `Thou hast revived us; we find grace in the eyes of my lord, and have been servants to Pharaoh;'"

10648,ylt,"and I have lain with my fathers, and thou hast borne me out of Egypt, and buried me in their burying-place.' And he saith, `I -- I do according to thy word;'"

10663,ylt,"And Israel putteth out his right hand, and placeth `it' upon the head of Ephraim, who `is' the younger, and his left hand upon the head of Manasseh; he hath guided his hands wisely, for Manasseh `is' the first-born."
10664,ylt,"And he blesseth Joseph, and saith, `God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked habitually: God who is feeding me from my being unto this day:"
10665,ylt,"the Messenger who is redeeming me from all evil doth bless the youths, and my name is called upon them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and they increase into a multitude in the midst of the land.'"
10666,ylt,"And Joseph seeth that his father setteth his right hand on the head of Ephraim, and it is wrong in his eyes, and he supporteth the hand of his father to turn it aside from off the head of Ephraim to the head of Manasseh;"
10667,ylt,"and Joseph saith unto his father, `Not so, my father, for this `is' the first-born; set thy right hand on his head.'"
10668,ylt,"And his father refuseth, and saith, `I have known, my son, I have known; he also becometh a people, and he also is great, and yet, his young brother is greater than he, and his seed is the fulness of the nations;'"
10669,ylt,"and he blesseth them in that day, saying, `By thee doth Israel bless, saying, God set thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh;' and he setteth Ephraim before Manasseh."
10670,ylt,"And Israel saith unto Joseph, `Lo, I am dying, and God hath been with you, and hath brought you back unto the land of your fathers;"
